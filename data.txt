Ah, geez, I'm runnin' late! Who said that?! Oh, it's the intercom. Ah, I'm not the only one who's late. SUCKER! Ha hah! Shit! I didn't know I was THAT late! Oh, man... 8:47... I am so dead. Shit... I need to buy a watch; I'm already on probation with the company. They could fire me. Oh well! What can you do? Bzzt! High-security... Am I on the right train? Oh! What's this? Huh... what...? Yeah, "High Security"! That's why we leave armed missiles lying around for everyone to check out. It's part of the tour. Fascists! Yeah, whatever, I'll drink a 40-ounce up here if I feel like it. Yeah, well, I'll stick my arms out the window if I-- Okay, maybe not. Hey, what's going on there? I should've been a pilot. Hah! Wow... Man, how dumb would you have to be? I mean, they're not gonna to say something like that unless somebody's already tried to do it, right? I guess if I was drunk enough, I might climb out the window here and pull some hangtime on the electrified tram rail. That kind of reminds me of that squirrel that got caught between the power lines one day back at MIT. The thing caught on fire and got fused to the wires, which caused a transformer to blow up and knock out the power to all of campus. That squirrel must've cost the university at least $10,. That was a good day. Oh man! I forgot about that! Personnel will be announced I need to practice. What? We're physicists. I don't believe in friends. Oh, cool! A robot! Robots are the only friends I need. Man! Look at that thing! Looks like a giant worker ant. Man, robots rule! Pneumatics rule! That's awesome. Man, they're still talking about hiring? I guess my cousin Jessie needs a job. If only he wasn't a sex-offender, it would be so much easier to find something for him. Bluh! Don't remind me. Whoa...WE'RE GOING TO CRASH! Oh, good, it stopped. What are YOU looking at?! Hey, what's that green crap? What is this? Jesus Christ! Look at this place! This is a DISASTER! That's gotta be toxic. God, the EPA is going to tear us apart if they find out about that. Well, I'm not saying anything. I don't want to get called into court as a witness on this once the cat gets out of the bag. Locked! Hm... Yeah, you know what? I don't even care anymore. By the time I get suited up, I'm going to be over an hour late. I figure, I'm either fired or I'm not. Is someone following me? Okay, good. Yeah, I'm just going to stroll in there like I own the damned place, take my time, maybe get some doughnuts... If I'm fired, I could probably jack some office supplies or computer equipment or something on the way out. I could just stuff things in a big duffel bag, nobody's going to notice. Hmm, y'know, Steve's never in his cubicle. I could just walk right up and take his laptop. Hell! I could grab that color laser printer from Accounting. That thing's nice! That's gotta be worth a couple grand right there. Huh, I wonder if it can print money... Okay, act calm, act calm. If I don't act calm, they're gonna know something's up when I walk in there. Okay, easy, control your breathing. Breathe normally, breathe normally. That'll make you calm. Oh, God, they can see me now. Okay, keep against the wall and try and walk straight passed the front desk. Don't make eye-contact, just walk. WALK! DAMMIT! I was so close! Really? Maybe I'm not fired. In that case, let me show you what a genius I am and look at your computer. Uh, yeah. Let's see. Wait a minute, this is a Windows blue screen. And you're typing on it like you know what you're doing. You're not doing anything. Shut up. You're just looking busy. That's your whole job, isn't it? Looking busy. Look, you have to reboot it. Where's the reset button? Is this it? Well, that's not it. Okay, you can all go to Hell if you're gonna act like that. See if I ever do anything nice for you again. Because I won't. What was that?! You tryin' to say somethin' about me?! Man, I'll kill you! Pricks... Well, they've got some lip up in here, I'll say that much. Makes me wonder what else they're saying behind my back. Well, it doesn't matter. I could take on any of them. 'sup, fool? Man, someday I'm gonna own this place. Wup, there's management. Let me guess what they're talking about. "You, sir, are mad! Dinosaurs are reptiles! They must be cold-blooded!" "Now, you listen and you listen good: "birds are one of the closest living relatives to dinosaurs we have. "And I don't need to tell you they're all warm-blooded." "Do you know how difficult it is to maintain thermostasis for an animal so large? "They're cold-blooded, I tell you!" "Let me tell you something. "There's evidence to suggest that velociraptors had feathers. "Feathers! Now, what does that tell you?" All right, this is stupid. I may as well go to work. I'm glad I'm not fired. That means I don't have to loot the place. Stealing from work is so much more stressful than not stealing from work. There's just no comparison. Move it, blue stuff. Uh... I knew that. This is kinda awkward... Did I really go the wrong way? Yep, there it is: Sector B. Man, I am tripping this morning! Wait a second, did I see what I think I did? Yep, I sure did--Newton's formula for gravitational force. Having trouble remembering that one, guys? What is this? Are we back in high school now? My department is working on quantum displacement. Just what the hell are you guys doing? Jerking around in labcoats from the looks of things. I just can't believe it. Those monkeys in there are having trouble learning about gravity, whereas I can recite the quantum chromodynamic gauge invariant Lagrangian in my sleep! There is no justice. Am I hearing things? TURN DOWN THE MUSIC, YOU FRIGGIN' BASSHEADS! IT SOUNDS LIKE A STRIP CLUB IN HERE! GOD DAMN! JUST GET SOME DANCING GIRLS IN CAGES, WHY DON'T YOU? GOOD LORD! MAN! Programmers... Who knows what they're doing in there? They're going to go deaf before the end of the year at that rate. Next time I have to go in there, I'll bring some ear protection. What? Is he talking to me? He's not even looking this way. I could've sworn I heard something... Ah, I'm losing my mind. Well, at least it sounded friendly, unlike that prick back at the lobby. "This place is dead..." Oh! I see a bowl of noodles with my name on it. Okay, I can do this. The guy on the left isn't looking but the guy on the right is a rogue element. Uh... Uh-oh, he's walking towards me. Stay cool, stay cool. Oh, man, this guy's a pro. I can't compete with this! I shouldn't have hesitated; I had it! Oh well, I guess I'll have to grab something else for breakfast, like some oxycodone! I think it's time to go visit my locker, get some happy pills and make the politics here just float away. Oh, you wanna know why? I'll tell you why. It's symbolic. The management wants you to know that you're their dog, so you're their leash. You don't see me wearing a tie, do you? You know why? Because I'm a rebel. The day they tried to enforce the dress code on me, I let them know there could be an accident around here if that happened. And by 'accident', I mean 'bomb the place'. Hey, are you even listening? Eh, forget you. My voice falls on deaf ears. I don't even know why I waste time on you sheep. I wonder if Feynman felt the same way. What the hell? Whose stuff is this? There's my name, but... But, here's a bowling certificate, baby pictures, blue poncho...? WHERE'S ALL MY STUFF?! WHERE'S MY STASH?! This is freaking me out. It's like everything's backwards, and I'm not even left-handed. Okay, I'm just gonna go to work and hope all these problems go away. Yeah. Oh, come on! Now somebody's taken my helmet! Eh, screw it, I probably won't need it anyway. Oh no, there's that voice. Shh! Quiet! Wow, this suit does not shut up. system: activated; Okay, this thing's ridiculous, where's the 'off' button? There we go. Huh, didn't it say, "Munitions level monitoring"? What does that mean? Does the left hand turn into a chaingun? I wish! Looks like you're in the barrel today. Oh! Did he just say I'm in the barrel today? Oooh, shit! Looks like I'm not the only person who knows some dirty jokes. "You're in the barrel..." I can't believe he said that. I bet he says that to the other scientists and it goes right over their head. He probably thinks I don't know what it means either, but I do. "You're in the barrel." Oh, wait. I can't remember which way to go. Was it left? Right? Nnnnnnnrrryuhh... I'll go this way. Hope it's good. Safety! American bad ass! And more soulless walls of concrete. Wait a second. Was that the same hallway? Ohh! It is! It didn't even matter. Those sneaky architect bastards. I have to say, though, working in an underground laboratory is pretty cool. It kind of makes me feel like I'm an evil scientist. I always wanted to be an evil scientist. Muhahahahahaha... Uh-hahahahahahaha... Huhehehahahahahaha...! WAAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-Hah! Okay, I'd better chill out. I don't want a repeat of Monday. Deep breaths... Heeeeyyyyy... wait, I don't know you. Don't confuse me. Everything... this way. Awesome. LASER! Caution. LASER! Caution. LASER! Caution. LASER! What could it mean? How about you? You know any jokes? No? Oh well. Man, I've gotta get my mind out of the gutter. Okay, could this hallway be more depressing? This lighting is crap! It's either too dark or has this sickly green look. Y'know, it wouldn't kill them to get some bulbs down here that give off UV rays. Nice hair. FedEx'd it and everything, huh? You know, sometimes I think you guys are just robots, except not cool. I wonder if we built this facility on an ancient Indian burial ground. I mean, this is New Mexico. You know, I still have no idea what these things are. Yes, it IS good to see me. They look like toy plasma globes, but what use would we have for that? HIT THE DECK! I thought it was a sniper...! I guess that wouldn't make sense. Let's have a look here. Ah, yeah, that's busted. Whoa! Damned Cyrix processors... You go with the lowest bidder and this is what happens. Glad that's not my problem. Oh no. Not this elevator. I hate it; it always makes me dizzy. Okay, maybe if I turn at the right time with it, I won't be dizzy. Left... right... no, wait, the other way. Clockwise... Counter-clockwise... no! Oh man, I still messed it up again; I'm still dizzy. Well, it's not as bad as those teacup rides at Disneyland. I hate those. They're designed so if you puke out the side, you spray as many people as possible. You know it! Hm. Am I the only person here with a beard? I understand that the guards don't have them, but the scientists? Something's wrong here. I don't care. Hell yeah! Me too! Let's let him in now. Does my beard intimidate you? Nyaaaaahhh! Stop that noise! I hate that! It reminds me of that dream I have where I'm strapped to a gurney watching Fraggle Rock with flashing lights on either side of me. Then I realize: I'm in Hell! It's all crap anyway. The only reason we have those scanners is because they caught playing racquetball in here once. Eh, better not. Roger, Roger. What's your vector, Victor? I like climbing things. It appeals to my simian instincts. And also makes me regret how I have no tail. Damn my genes. I have no tail and I must swing. Wha-what do you think I'm doing? Hey, I could just sit here and not do a damned thing. Bet you'd like that, huh? Ungrateful pricks. I'm going to start making a list of names around here. And you're going to be towards the top of the list. This is getting ridiculous. I never thought I'd have so many enemies that I'd need to make an actual list. But, it's just getting to be more than I can keep track of. I mean, what the hell, it worked for Nixon, it should work for me, right? in 3... 2... 1... Pow! Yeah. At times like this I remember why I became a physicist: To show antimatter particles who's BOSS! YEAH! Pew! Awesome. Totally awesome. I'm not talking to you. You're on the list. I'm doing this because I want to. Wait, isn't that a little dangerous? What? Seriously, I hope we get some good readings today. Depending on what we find, we might just disprove string theory. That would make my day. If we do, I'm not going to be gracious about it, either. I'm going to rub people's FACES in it. So, what's the deal, guys? You ready or what? All right. I hate it when he talks like that. Next, he's going to start smacking his lips. Huh? Huh, yeah, wouldn't want to take the blinders off the horse, now would ya? Whatever. OH GOD! WHAT-WHAT DO I DO? WHAT-WHAT DO I DO? OH, NO, NO, NO! THIS IS NOT GOOD! LET ME OUT OF HERE! OPEN UP THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR, YOU BASTARDS! RRRRGH! I HATE YOU! THIS IS A BAD EXPERIMENT! WE ARE BAD PEOPLE! WHY DID WE USHER FORTH THE GREEN APOCALYPSE?! What happened?! What is this? Am I dead? I don't feel dead. But, how would I know? If this is what it's like to be dead, then being dead SUCKS! Oh, shit! That's the ceiling! WHERE'S MY HELMET?! ...what the fuck? WHO ARE YOU?! NO! I DON'T WANNA BE A SCHIZOPHRENIC! Oh my God, this is crazy-in-a-box with a side order of fries! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... Huh? Heh? Ah-hah? Ah-hah-hah! Ah! I'm not in Crazy Land anymore! Oh, man! That was stranger than when I was awake for four days straight and thought my house was being invaded by frog people. And the door's open now! Man, I'm on a roll! Murphy's Law can suck it! Oh, hell. Is that guy dead? Dammit, I'm a doctor, not a... normal doctor. I wonder if he was trying to open the door for me. I'd feel like an asshole then. Wait, what am I saying? They're the ones that locked me in this tomb to begin with! If they're not dead all ready, they're on the list! Hah, yeah, very funny. C'mon door, open up. Dammit, what a tease! I already made it passed those thick-ass blast doors--which that guy died for-- only to be stopped by this useless second door. This is bullshit! I am Captain Gordon Freeman of the Intergalactic House of Pancakes ordering you to open! Yes! No! Shit! Uh... Don't kill me! Oh, good. Somebody who knows CPR. I hate to say it, but I don't think I could bring myself to do mouth-to-mouth on the people here. Dammit, all the babes are in the Biology Department. I'd LEARN how to do CPR on them. That is, unless they really were dead. God, that would be such a turn-off. Don't step in the blood... Man, you can just smell the money burning in this place. Just goes to show that-- GOD! JEEZ! GOD! I HATE COMPUTERS! WHY DO THEY ALWAYS BLOW UP WHEN I USE THEM?! Boned. Man, this place got romped! I guess I'll start looting after all. Hm, I'll get out of here first and then come back here with a wheelbarrow so I can really do this right. Oh no, not this again. Okay, this time I have to turn WITH the elevator. All right, focus. Mehninmehninmehninmehninmehninmehninmehnin mehninmehninmehninmehninmehninmehninmehnin... Oh, jeez, this doesn't feel good. I don't think it worked. Why is everything in circles? Atoms... planets... yeah. Huh-hey! Boy, we really fucked up this time, huh? I'd see a resonance cascade, Sucks. You like it? him and all our phones are out. surface as soon as you can know we're stranded down here. activate the retinal scanners. of the Science Team will gladly help you. See, that's what I like to hear: how can you help me? If everyone here had your attitude, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. Oh my God! What is that? Holy crap, that's an alien! I wasn't imagining it. Do they see this? HEY, I TOLD YOU ALL I'M NOT CRAZY! THE PROOF'S RIGHT HERE! Wow, it looks like one of those facehuggers from the movie "Aliens". Wah! Don't kill me! I realize you're trying to propagate your species, but I'm just down with the whole laying-eggs-in-my-chest-cavity thing. Jeez, that's a lot of blood. Oh, a locked door. We're playing this game again, are we? Fine! Ugh... step in the blood... there. WHAT?! YOU DARE DEFY MY ORDERS?! THIS IS TREASON! I'LL HAVE YOU--hey, wait a minute, I think that scientist said he could open it. I'll ask him. Don't let it smell your fear. Hey, you guys have the same tie. Well, that's why we have insurance. Hey, come with me for a second. All right. Oh, and don't mind the vicious aliens. Or the dead guy. Or the tunnel of blood. Yeah, just start that peep show so we can get things rolling. This next door better not be locked. WHOA! Okay, the green beams of death. I thought we were passed this already. Getting a little old. Hey, why don't you go first? C'mon, age before beauty. Fine! I'll lead. This right here is why you're never get promoted. Okay, here we go. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! And he's safe! Is that guy not even coming? What a hoser. When I'm in charge, I'll make sure he stays at the bottom of the corporate ladder. Actually, I'm not sure I even want this place anymore now that I-- Oh God, one of them's loose. Uh... can't turn back. Okay, I can do this. I am a matador! I fearlessly-- AH GOD! JESUS! SHIT! FUCK! Piss! God... Those things BITE! Dammit! I'm starting to feel pretty naked here without a weapon. This is such a slap to the face. I've been meaning to take kung fu lessons for years now because I knew there would be a day, like today, and I would be ready, but I kept putting it off, and here I am, totally unprepared, and not knowing kung fu. Procrastination has failed me yet again. Wait, this is it. This is my chance for redemption. It's like my entire life has leading up to this single moment. Today, all my limbo practice pays off! Oh! Cleared it! I am the limbo master. Isn't that right, dead guy? The bonus round! Okay, I need to study the pattern. Hey, is it getting warmer? YAH! WOW! I almost got a free haircut and lobotomy! Damn! Hey, I can't limbo this; it goes through the floor! That's cheating! Look at this thing! It's an Etch-a-Sketch from Hell! Okay, I'm just going to have to wing it. Hey, is that a crowbar? Oh my God. This is friggin' perfect. Now I can beat the SNOT out of people! Oh boy, I can't wait to get back to the lobby. They'll be like, "Freeman! We thought you were dead!" I'll be like, "You thought wrong! Pow!" Okay, time to bring on the pain. Oh-ho! Another locked door! I don't think so! I've got a crowbar! Eat this! Hey, I can just crawl through here. I am a genius. God, I love this thing! I just want to beat stuff up now. Actually, that's all I wanted to do anyway but now it's so easy. Wickapah! "Do not use elevators." Oh shit, they weren't kidding! Aw jeez, what do I do? The door won't open... rrrrr! Oh, what should I do? I guess, uh... SORRY! DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL YOU! Oh, man... I hope at least they were jerks... Well, that's it. I've gone and killed two guys. All my life, I've wanted to kill people just by pressing a button. And now that I've done it, it's... just... not what I was hoping for. How am I going to get out of here now? Oh, sweet, a service ladder. Seems like stairs would've made more sense but that's not my problem, for I am the climbing master. Hey, that's the problem: I didn't KNOW I was killing anybody; it was manslaughter. I should've--whoa-ho-ho! Better not look down. "Manslaughter" sounds worse than "murder", like I'm a butcher in some evil meat shop and ground up a bunch of people to-- Uh-oh! Gunshots! Somebody's going postal. I knew this would happen. Wait, that's not... what is that? Maybe I should be more like this guy. If he doesn't know what something is, he just shoots it dead. Whoa! Quick draw! YEAH! SHOOT IT! HELL YEAH! That was bad ass. I can see why you took this job. Still, what is going on?! Is this guy contagious? I'm getting out of here. I hope I'm not infected. I'll never get a date if I end up looking like those guys. Oh boy! Another body. Y'know, normally following a trail of bodies covered in blood is a sign you're going the WRONG way. Follow the dead body road. Follow the dead body road. Follow, fol-- Damn! Look at all that blood. That must be a few hundred dollars' worth if you were to donate all that. I wonder if the organs are still good. I could make a fortune selling them from all these dead guys. I guess I could still sell the cadavers if I could move them before the cops arrive. Nah, they'd probably just try to arrest me again. Oh no! It's the ghosts of those two guys coming back to haunt me! Oh, wait. They're just monsters. Uh...what do I do? Oh, I know. I'll stand still. They'll pass by me because they don't have any eyes. AAAH! Dammit! How did they see me? That is so unfair! They don't have any eyes! This place bites. I'm going to find another job. Oh good! More blood! I was starting to get worried! God, what happened? This guy looks like he got hit by a steamroller. Gah! Why did THAT blow up? Did we wire this place to self-destruct or something? I guess we don't have enough dead people here yet. I've got to get out of here. Oh, you've gotta be shitting me... I'm going to sue the HELL out of Black Mesa when I get out of here! Locking your workers in? That's what the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory did; locked its workers in, then there was a fire then everybody died. That's a formula for success! DAMMIT! Wow, we're making history right now! CRAP HISTORY! RRRRR! What? Ha-hah! I am incredible. Is there any end to the number of problems I can solve just by beating the hell out of something? I'm not sure there is! Yep! That's how I say "Open sesame": with a crowbar to the face! Aw man, the tram's gone. You're waiting for it too, huh? Hey, you sure this catwalk's safe? Hey, why is the guard dead? You kill him? I want some answers! Uh-oh. Oh jeez. Okay, give me your hand! No, your OTHER hand, you idiot! Ah, you suck! Now you're dead and I STILL can't get out of here! Thanks for nothing! Why does everyone have to keep dying on me? Is it really so hard to just not die? I mean, look at me. I was in the chamber at friggin' Ground Zero and I'm still here! Yet, you guys slip on a banana peel and that's it! Ugh, Darwin was right. I didn't realize I was working with a bunch of lemmings. I guess I may as well check that opening out. I'll go around so I don't have to walk in the blood. Though, honestly, at the rate I'm going, I'll be knee deep in it before I get out of here. At least they turned the volume down. Oh, crap! Another facehugger. Ha ha ha! Oh, that's just great. My enemy is the enemy of my other enemy. I wouldn't hate computers so much if they did more useful things like that. I wonder if the guys in here died from the aliens or just raved themselves to death. Okay, place is blowing up, time to leave. Escape from techno hell! Hey, one of the guys is fighting the facehugger! C'mon, hit it! Hit it with a stick! Aww... Those things really ARE facehuggers! I hope they don't bleed acid, too. I'm glad I watched the movie. Okay, twitching dead guy and a strobe light. That's not creepy at all. I'm... just... gonna... go... ...yeah... Hey-hey. Gunshots. Where there's a gun, there's fun. Or not. Uh-oh. Uh, you need some help? Guess not, huh? Well... Whoa-ho-ho-ho, what's this? Your death was not in vain, pal. I'll shoot everyone in this building if I have to. Welp, time to play God. Let's see people disrespect me now. They'll find out what happens when you mess with the Freeman. Alright, so what do we have here? Semi-automatic, some sort of glock, safety's off. Man, good thing I've watched Die Hard like 50 times, otherwise, I wouldn't know anything about guns. Nice! A full clip. That guard must've reloaded before he died. How considerate of him. Oh, this again. Okay. I'll play your game. In the future, everything will be like this. Doors, computers... No! Man, come on! That thing teleported out of friggin' nowhere! Why?! I don't even know what this is. Maybe I was hasty shooting it. This could be an ambassador. Okay, if I see another one, I'll listen to what it has to say. Speak of the devil. FUCK! DAMMIT! IT'S THE SAME STORY EVERY TIME! YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, AND THEY TRY AND KILL YOU! THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR TRYING TO BE NICE! Oh-ho, here we go. SUCK ON THIS, YOU JUMPING BOOGERS! Someone up there?! Guess not. Well, that felt good. Ah. I guess that's the Room of Death. Don't want to go in there. Nice of them to put up signs, though. Huh, that's the symbol for poison. I bet these barrels are filled with poison. Maybe we're just trying to kill the whole world. Doing a good job so far. I'm guessing I'm not going to like what's behind Door #1 here. I was right. Drurrhhh! Drrruuurrrgh! Damn, that hurts! Daaah. Okay, that's it! It's official: All aliens are bastards! Especially you! And you! Hold still. Nice! That was a pretty good shot. Not so tough now that I've got a gun, are ya? Oh, this is a dead end. Hey, a jack in the box. Maybe I was being too hard on everybody about them staying alive earlier. I'm starting to see where they could have some problems with that. Now why do we have bars here? Do we have our own prison block, too? And you! You're the problem. You know how they say you're either part of the help or part of the problem? Well, they were talking about you! There. Now you're part of the solution. All right, let's see. I've gotten out of tougher cells than this. Or not. Wait, what's this? I guess it's either this or the Rooms of Death. Hey, wait, how do I get back up? Damn. White men in armored hazmat suits can't jump. You know, I'm not sure if coming down here was either smart or else really stupid. Although the same could be said for today's experiment. It would've been really smart if it had worked. I guess this opens the gate. Oh, no! That was stupid! I'm gonna die! Hey, I'm on the other side. I guess I'm still not sure if that was smart or stupid. I guess it was both. Smupid. Oh, lovely. This must be our Pipeline of Poison. Yuck, I was swimming in that. Knowing the toxic sludge we're so fond of, my skin's gonna turn red, my hair will fall out, and I'll start pissing blood. Thanks, Black Mesa! Don't be a dead end. Oh, good. It goes somewhere. I'm not sure I really want to be going down into the center of the Earth, but then I don't see an emergency exit! Hey, some ammo clips. At least somebody's trying to cheer me up. Ugh, they're covered in blood. It was nice of him to die for me so I could have his ammo, but I just don't know if it's worth this. Now it's all over my suit. I guess this starts the lift. Whoa! Train's leaving the station! All aboard! No, not you! You don't have a ticket! Urgh. Damn... This suit does not protect against gravity. Hey, what was that? Face-huggers! Yee... batter up! Strike one! Strike two! Str- Aah! It's raining men! I-I mean aliens! Why is this taking so long? I could fall faster than this. NO! SHUT UP! NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION! YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS! YOU'RE ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! NOW, DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD AND JUMP IN THIS GIANT MEAT GRINDER! NO! YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG! YOU'RE ALL INCOMPETENT! Come on, come on, c'mon, cmoncmoncmoncmon! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS! OH, THAT'S GOOD! TELEPORT IN MORE CREEPS! THIS PLACE ISN'T CRAZY ENOUGH, YET! WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT HAPPENED?! WHY DO ALL THESE CATWALKS SUCK SO BAD? I CAN'T JUMP THIS! What do I do? Uhhh... Oh, good. I was hoping you'd come along to hurry me up. Okay, this is stupid. So far, so good. Don't slip. Now what? This sucks. Dammit. How come that catwalk doesn't have any supports? The last one had dangling cables after it collapsed. If I had one of those, I could swing across to the other side like Tarzan. That would be dope. They did that in Star Wars, too. Dude swinging across a gap with some babe holding onto him. That was a grappling hook, though. That's what this suit needs: a grappling hook. Then I could swing my way to victory instead of performing this balancing act. Bugs can crawl on walls. Maybe I should've been a bug. Go Team Kafka! I'd at least want four arms like the god Shiva. Okay, now I have some options. I can either fall to my death in this black pit, land on the edge and gore myself on the jagged metal mesh, or land on the concrete and maybe break my legs. And before, all I had was the pit. Jee-heez! I'm going to have arthritis by the time I'm 30 at this rate. Assuming I even live that long. Ah, who am I kidding? I've got a gun. Oh, what the hell? Another catwalk is out? And what is THAT? It's got tentacles for a face. It's a Cthulhu dog. Well, it's attacking the face-huggers; it can't be all bad. I'll just wait until it's done with them and-- Plegh! Tastes like dead caterpillars! Pleh! Okay, squid-head. Say hello to Yog-Sothoth and the Elder Gods for me! Hey, a rope! Now I can be Tarzan! Hey, wait, that's not a rope. That's a...these are like... jellyfish or something. If I swung on that, it could come crashing down on me. These aliens are just good for nothing. These crates are good for something. This one just broke my fall. That means aliens are worth less than crates. Which is, what, a few bucks? Well, at least I got to rinse my mouth out. What I really need is some toothpaste, but now it tastes a little bit less like squid snot. If that water's toxic, too, then at least the toxins are tasteless. I'll have time to worry about mouth cancer later. Hey, wait. What's up with this ceiling? That looks like a ceiling designed to have moving walls that crush people. Well, there's no bloodstains. Oh, God. That was a pun. "What's up with this ceiling?" What's wrong with me? I'd punch somebody in the mouth if they said that to me. Huh. Wow.... I wasn't expecting this. This... this must be our box-smashing room. I mean, what, we have a bottomless pit, and the sides are all plate metal that look strong enough to withstand a missile blast. This room must've cost a couple hundred thousand to build. Eat your heart out, taxpayers. This is where your money goes. I mean, we get most of our money from the Department of Defense, and this is what we're spending it on. And here, I thought my division was wasting money. We were doing a hell of a lot more than smashing boxes. This whole company's just retarded. Ugh, there's no door up here. Is there really no way around this? What do the workers normally do? Just ride the crates down like it's a ski-lift? Well... Okay, extreme hopscotch! Let's do this! No room for error here. It kind of reminds me of that cooking show I saw filmed in the Philippines, where two chefs would compete against each other to make the best dish, and, at the end, they would cut the loser's head off with a sword. I think the show got cancelled. Well, now I have an answer if anyone ever asks me what the dumbest thing I've ever did was. I can say-WHOA! "There was this one time I was jumping across these crates suspended above "a bottomless pit, even though I didn't really know where I was going. "Or-or-or, there was the time I crawled into a drainage pipe, "opened up the floodgate and almost drowned. "I shouldn't even be alive, really." Ahh, made it. So, where do these things go that we need so many crates? That doesn't go anywhere. That's a wall. That.... That means we're just loading up crates so we can drop them over that pit. That means that there's no damned point to this whole room. This whole place is such a wash. Good ol' New Mexico. We're really making a name for the state. First, they invented the atomic bomb in Los Alamos. Now, we've invented mean-ass aliens that teleport out of nowhere. I'm not sure which is worse. You know, when they invented the atomic bomb, they were afraid it was going to catch the atmosphere on fire and burn up the whole earth, but they did it anyway. That took balls. Not us, though. The only people taking the risks were the ones that didn't understand them in the first place. We're not brave. We're just stupid. Well, I'm on the other side. So, that's what? Three-for-three? Man, we've picked the wrong contractor to build these catwalks. El Sleazo's Discount Construction. Bribing building inspectors for over 40 years. YES! Time to get the hell out of here. I hate elevator music. Hm. I better reload. Never know when I'll be making new friends around here. Huh, we've got so many dead bodies, we're hanging them from the ceiling now. And the ceiling eats them. Guess that works. Wha-hoah! That shock just got the face-hugger! And another one! Will this guy make it? No! You're all popcorn. That really does have to be more than coincidence. I mean--GYAH! I mean--GYAH! Okay, I guess I'm not going that way. Where am I going? The blood trail's gone up into the ceiling. Ah! "Administrative offices..." Yeah, no exit! No one leaves here. What's that say? "Work harder, not smarter." Yeah, that's us, alright. We stay the course with stupid. Hey, there's somebody in there. Hey, there's somebody in there. Hey, quit screwing around and open the door! Come on! The door's locked, assholes! Dammit! Y'know, it's hard to believe we won the Cold War with initiative like that. That's not the spirit that kept Soviet paratroopers off my lawn. If somebody knocks on the door, you don't run away and go play with aliens. Ah, an air vent. Die Hard has shown me the way once again. Now we're making progress. I think. What? BUG! This is MY air vent. Hey, this is a dead end. And so are you! DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE! These bugs think they own the place. Well, there's going to be some restructuring around here. Oh, there's another one. That's right. Keep running, you little bastard. I see you thinking you're going to escape. Well, you're WRONG! Just like everyone else here! RRAAAAAH! Man, today is so counterintuitive to everything I did in grad school. I would shout and break stuff there, too, but that never got anything done. So, what's the deal with--AAHHH... Grody! I hate this place. What's that noise? Ugh, that makes not even want to loot the machine now. I was going to grab some Doritos or something. Oh, but look who it is. What? Don't interrupt me. The man who can't open the door. Yes? Of course. Well, I believe you. But, does my gun believe you? Oh, all right. I'll let you live, but you're on the preliminary list. What's this? "High voltage"? Cool. Maybe I can fry those things hanging from the ceiling. Oh, that turned it off. Oh well. I wonder if that guy's right about--Don't puke on me. --that guy's right about waiting here. I would feel stupid if there was a rescue team waiting in the lobby. All right, looks like that cut the power. Now, I can pass safely, proving once again that I am superior to aliens. And everyone. What?! I WENT THROUGH THAT OBSTACLE COURSE FOR THIS?! I HATE THIS BUILDING! I WANT TO SMASH THE WHOLE THING DOWN! I WANT TO SMASH THE WHOLE THING DOWN! Oh, well that works. Maybe I should become a burglar after this. I'm getting the hang of breaking- and-entering and I like stealing stuff. Wow, glad that's not my lab. "Scheduled Chaos Theory"? That makes as much sense as "Grounded Aviation". Or "Deep Sea Astronomy". Of course. Every door is locked. Always. Why is every door locked? This is a workday. It's not like I'm breaking out on Sunday evening. Ah! Thought I didn't see you, huh? I'm watching. I'm always watching. Well, the sign was right. This looks like storage. Another dead end. This must be the prep room for the crate-smashing room. Crate City: For All Your Creative Crate Needs Y'know, I'm torn between wanting to kill every single bug in this building or just leveling it with explosives. I need a bomb. Nah, that's probably a janitor closet. This window kind of reminds me of when I came home from school and there was some dead guy stuck in the smashed window of my apartment. He had been trying to break into the place, but instead gutted himself on the insulated glass. That was not fun trying to explain that to the police. Oh, what's that? Another air vent. These people locking doors think they're smart, but they're not. Guess I'd better clear out all this glass, first. I'm kind of like glass, in a way. I'll tear people to shreds when I can't do my job. All right, so, this is not very comfortable. Okay! That water's got some electricity running through it. I didn't really plan for that, but, that's okay. That's okay. I can do this. I just need a breather for a second. Yeah, I can do this. Hell, I've gotten hit with Tasers that do more than that. Women are too damned jumpy with those things. I swear, half the dates I go on, it's just 'zap'. That's not as bad as pepper spray, though. God, I hate pepper spray. Oh, you son of a bitch. Gyeeeeaaaaaaggggghhhh... My ears! That was not smart. Firing a gun inside an air vent... I hope I'm not deaf... I need a silencer. And that whole electrical shock thing reminds me of that guy I used to know. What was his name? Jessie. He was crazy. He would--eugh. He would lie on his bed then drop a cattle-prod on his leg with the voltage set so high he would just be paralyzed there for an hour or two. He did that all the time for fun. Personally, I could think of better ways to spend an evening--AH SHIT! Yep, whoever designed this building did not count on me. Oh, copy cats! Forgot to copy that move, huh? Actually, I'd better shut up. It would be just my luck for these aliens to figure out how to use guns. Any more takers? No? All right, let's-- --cry... This locked door thing is getting real old. Ay yi yi yi yi yi... What now? Well, back to crawling in the ceiling like a voyeur. Ah, the hunter spots his prey. He takes aim. Crikey! And that's about as close as it gets! Now what are aliens doing up here, anyway? I guess they must've teleported in, but how do they know where to go? Ohh, maybe they don't! Maybe they're teleporting into the walls. That could be why the building's falling apart. We're turning into the Swiss Cheese of the Damned. Wait, what if one teleported inside me? Oh, geez, I don't think I could take that. Whoa, what happened here? Agh! God! Jeez! Shit! What was that?! Who's firing?! Did I get hit? I don't see any blood. If I could just see-- FUCK! It's like... It's like a turret gun or something. You okay? Eh, I don't care. Jesus Christ! Oh, some clips, I'll take that. Yes! An exit. Oh my God! This is where I just came from! Maybe that's why all the doors are locked. To keep people like me from wandering into a firing range. Hey, want to be my human shield? It was just an idea. Um... no, that's just a dead end. Maybe I could force him out there if I waved my gun at him. Shit, did I say that out loud? Yep, it's still there. Okay. Well, this is about as good a time to take a break as any. Wait, this isn't gonna work. If a rescue team comes, that gun's gonna turn them into peppered steak. Good idea. Yep. You're right. There's a firing delay when it's not beeping. And there's another bug! Damn, these things are faster than the centipedes in my house! Eh, screw it. I'll just wait until the beeping stops, then make a dash for it. It's just as well. I wasn't looking forward to staying here and cannibalizing that guy for food. Oh, back for more, huh? Nah, you're on your own, chump. Pew! Sweet! Man, that guy back there is just screwed. Well, once again, not my problem. Oh, what the-- OKAY, CHILDREN, CLASS IS IN SESSION! EVERYONE TAKE YOUR SEATS! I SAID, "EVERYONE TAKE YOUR SEATS!" DAMMIT, BILLY, THAT MEANS YOU, TOO! TAKE YOUR SEAT! Okay, now today's lesson is on--wait, what am I doing? I don't know. Y'know, facial lacerations aside, that was pretty pimp of me. I need a sword. And a helmet. And a horse. Yeah. Hey, can I have your gun? I thought it'd be cool to shoot people with two pistols like I'm in a John Woo movie or something. Uhh... Fine, don't say anything, ya freak. Oh, I guess he was using it. Still, one gun is fun, but two is Woo-tastic. What? Gah! Dammit! I'm getting sick of these face-huggers trying to French me. It's not like I'm that hard up. Christ. Oh, what's this? Oh, doing the vent thing, huh? Yeah, I was-- Ugh! You dumbasses! You can't go through the fan blades! Some people just have to learn things the hard way. I mean, it only took me one time to learn not to stick your head in a fan. Oh no... DAAAH! Quit zapping me! Let's see how you like it! Dammit! Have to reload... Okay, pumpkinhead. Gah! These aliens suck! I'm already afraid of Muppets; I don't need this on top of that! Come out! They're not coming. You guys are even worse than the face-huggers, you know that? I need a name for you. I'm just going to call you 'zappers' until I can think of something better. Where the hell are they? Oh, I can hear them. I'd better check my flank. That's how they got that dude in Jurassic Park. Oh, wait, those were raptors. Well, I'd shoot them, too. Bastard! THAT'S SO FRIGGIN' ANNOYING! It's not like the electricity kills me; it just hurts! I'm not sure what I'm more upset about: that they're shocking me, or that I can't shoot electricity from my hands. I'm going backwards again, aren't I? Boom! Oh, I see you, too! Oh, man! I shoot one long-distance through a window and another one that's waiting to jump me! That is James Bond intuition! Damn, I'm awesome! Dooh-duh-DAH-DAH! Duh, dehduh! How did that thing know I was here? How many of you fuckers are there? Do you want me to individually engrave your names on each of my bullets? Is my gun not personal enough for you? I'll kill every last one of you bastards. All I need are bullets. We have a lot of bullets here! EARTH IS A MINERAL-RICH PLANET! I BET YOURS SUCKS! It's probably a swamp planet with no metal! And, if it's not, you probably belong in a swamp, anyway! You should be out killing vacationing college students, not scientists trying to get work do-- What the fuck?! Now, I'm covered in blood! In my hair... This is going to jam my gun. And, what about you? Enjoying the show? YEAH, THANKS FOR THE WARNING, ASSHOLE! I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW YOU STOOD THERE STARING AT ME AND NOT DOING A GOD DAMNED THING! YOU'RE LIKE A CAT WATCHING A MOUSE DIE! I'm getting out of here. There's too many psychos in this place. What's that noise? WAAAH! MY EAR! I GOT SHOT IN THE EAR! WHY IS THE BUILDING TRYING TO KILL ME?! I'M AN EMPLOYEE! YOU DON'T SHOOT YOUR EMPLOYEES! You are NOT employees! DAMMIT! YOU'RE ALL FIRED! NO! Fuck this. I'm going to wait for that thing to power down. I can't believe that we have automatic turret guns. You shouldn't kill your workers. I thought they taught that in, like, Business 101. Okay... Man, I just don't get a break. Kneel before me! Ha ha ha ha ha ha.... Hah, no smoking around the turret gun. Bad for your health. Oh, oh! Yeah, keep on gargling; I'm reloading. And that's why you should stay in school. Man, I am not happy at all about getting my ear shot. I guess it's a free piercing, but I don't have a mirror. I don't want to look like I'm gay. I guess gay is when you get both ears pierced. Either that, or you're a sailor. Friggin' lunatic. Well, they're not coming fast enough! I got shot, y'know? Ah, first aid. Yeah. I need some gauze. Yeah, no shit, Skippy. I've got more blood on me than an ax murderer. I'd be arrested if I were to approach a child looking like this. I wonder if there's any more clips in here. I'm on my last one. I really wasn't expecting to use up all my ammo, but what can I say? This gun keeps solving my problems for me. Oh! An exit sign! It's about bloody time. Okay, remain calm. Jesus! Okay, we'll take this to the next level. What the fuck?! We installed bullet-proof glass on our exit doors? That stuff's not cheap. How retarded are we? I don't know anymore. Ugh. What did they think was going to happen? The turret guns were going to sprout a pair of legs and get up and leave? I'm just a rat in a maze. With no cheese. And you're not helping. I guess I am getting a gun out of the whole deal. That's registered in someone else's name! That means, once all this blows over, I'll be able to kill anyone and get away with it if I want to. Hey, I think that's an exit. Huh? Oh my God! THIS WAS NOT APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE! I'M NOT TAKING ANY QUESTIONS! NO COMMENT! NO COMMENT! NO COMMENT! Well, I can understand how some people can't get enough of me, but it's for their own good, really. Yay, something I can actually break. God, my face must look like a cutting board right now. I wonder if it'll scar. That would look badass if I had one of those face scars across the eye. And my ear. Who else has pierced ears? Artists, punk rockers, pirates... Huh, pirates have both ears pierced. But, then, they're sailors. Hey, is that coffee? Sweet, are there any doughnuts? Whoa! That's a big no. This isn't going to work. What the... they're deaf. They can't hear me. How the hell did they find me earlier? They don't have eyes. We may never know. Science will thank me someday. Alright, enough of this, I'm getting some coffee. Now, which button? Yeah, that's the stuff. Bwbwbwbwuuaaa! Coffeecoffeecoffee! Coffee! It's not as strong as methamphetamine but it lets you keep your teeth. Oh, this is just a walk-in freezer. I don't want any snow cones. I can't go back. Ah, maybe there's another air vent. Then I can crawl away forever. Ice. They need one of those safety signs. Ick, pig guts. You know, I'm starting to wish I hadn't gotten wet earlier. It's cold in here. Oh, more blood. Hey, where's the party? Oh God! Okay, lead the way. Where are we going? WHAT?! YOU'RE GOING TO HIDE IN THE CORNER? ARE YOU FIVE YEARS OLD? Man, now I'm almost out of bullets. Are you happy? I'm not! You know what, you can stay in the corner. You've earned it. I'm going to come back with a dunce cap for you and you're going to wear it. God, look at how big that thing is. And the teeth. I need more bullets; I can't be wrestling these things with my bare hands. Or a chainsaw. That would be cool. I need a chainsaw and a hockey mask. Then we'll see who messes with... Yes. Some more thoughtful people left me their ammo. Is that a hand grenade? Oh my God, it is! It's like Christmas around here. People are going to crap their pants if I wave this around. They'll do anything I want. I'm saving this for later. I'm not going to waste this on just anybody. Yep, back to lead salad for the rest of you. What's that noise? Quiet! Does the kitchen slaughter hogs in here? Gyah! Yeah, that's right, just puke on my suit. It doesn't matter anymore. It's already got blood all over it. Most of it's not even my blood; it's from the other alien that puked on me. I'm probably carrying a few blood-borne diseases on my suit. I'm a walking CDC nightmare. It makes me want to hug someone. You know with all these meat slabs hanging, I-- DAMMIT! Will you stop doing that?! I can't concentrate when you do that! What was I thinking about? Oh yeah, how are they getting those meat slabs in here? I thought there'd be a loading bay. Did they just hike them through the labs? Ah, dammit. I've gone in circles again. This always happens. Hey, there's my air vent. Does it lead back there? Yeah, there's another dead guy. That's a good sign, right? It's kind of a bummer. Here, I thought I was being original, but it looks like everybody's doing the air vent thing. Why can't I start my own fad? I guess I'm the only one that hasn't died doing this. That's kind of original around here. I still can't believe those idiots crawled into the fan blades. I once bet my old roommate to stick his hand in a blender and even he wasn't dumb enough for that. But you are! Hah! I bet you don't even have a frontal lobe. I'll take that. What is that thing? A car battery? That's not really worth pawning. It looks heavy. I'll leave it. Ah, nuts. I forgot to make a dunce cap for that guy. I was hoping I could find some poster board and a marker. Oh well, I'm not going back for him. I'm not going back for anybody. Whoa, a human skull. That would go great with my collection. Mm, maybe I'll wait. I don't want to clean it myself. Besides, I think Eddie said he was going to get some more in for pretty cheap. Where the hell am I? I should be careful. If I were to die right now, I bet no one would find my body. I can't let that happen. When I die, for my funeral, I want them to be shooting bombs off in the air, and have two F-16 fighter jets doing barrel rolls overhead. That would be awesome! And, really, it's what I deserve. God, who designed this room? M.C. Escher? It's like one of those little gerbil mazes where you make them run through the tubes. Except they get to cheat because th-- What? Because their tubes are transparent. And they're gerbils. I bet you eat gerbils. WELL, I'M NOT A GERBIL! God DAMN, those things are nasty! And it's flicking me off. I think. Why is there a ladder here if it doesn't go anywhere? I don't know. A scientist's job is to try and make sense of the world around him. But this whole building is crazy. Locked exits, Gordian Knot air ducts, a giant box-smashing room, it doesn't add up. The only time I feel like I know what I'm doing is when I'm shooting or breaking things. No wonder we spend so much money making missiles. I thought today's experiment might work, but instead, we blew up everything. That's what we do. Man, fighting in this vent is kind of cramped. It reminds me of that Jackie Chan movie where he fights some dude under a train car. That must've been hard. Surprise! Yo! Security! Wake up! Yeah, little slow, buddy! That other guy below us is way faster than you. Yeah, what do you think I've been doing, Gomer? Standing around, picking my nose? Yeah, tell that to your dead coworkers. I found a few of them in the vents. OH GOD! Oh, man. I thought I almost fell for that turret gun again. Because this stairway looks exactly like that other one. I still don't understand why-- Ah! Ah! See, I was ready for that. You can't teach this. Let's face it, not everyone is cut out to be me. I'm a physics-crunching badass. I'm the complete package. Oh, hey, hey! Can you open this door up? Why is he adjusting his tie? Oh, it must be a one-way mirror. I can't say I'm surprised by that anymore. We're a monument to misspending. I wonder if the CEO just rubs himself with money. Whoa! That guy's got some moves! Yeah, see, your falling sucks! Aw, man... Why'd you have to kill that guy? He's the only cool person I've seen. Anyone who'll dive through a window at his age is cool in my book. Grandpa was a fighter. Oh! More grenades! I think two will do me. I'd test one right now, but I don't want to level the building until I'm out of it. Why is it so hard to get out of the building? It's like everywhere I turn, there's another obstacle I have to dance around. I bet there's spikes at the bottom of this shaft. May as well be. Hup, got another dangler. I bet somebody's wishing they could do a pull-up right about now. Man, you have to be out of shape not to do one pull-up. You'd think that elevator shaft would get the adrenaline going. It does with me and I'm not the one about to die. You know, that's the nice thing about staying fit in an academic field. You can beat up most of your coworkers if you have to. Yeah, see, I can do a pull-up. All right! Fuck. Okay, well... hey hey! Snack machine! GIVE ME SOME DORITOS! What is this, Plexiglas? A-Alright alright, I got some change. B-6. Nacho Cheesier. Mm...that was good. Now I need to find a sink. My hands have cheese powder on them. I can't just wipe them off on somebody else's labcoat like I normally do. Well, I could use the dead guy's labcoat, but that's not sanitary. Feeling up dead people is how you get germs. Where am I going? I guess I'll check out that office. Oh! Is that a shotgun? Who keeps a shotgun and extra ammo in their office? That's hardcore. Who's the sheriff now? YEAH! I could do this all day. I need to find some more stuff to shoot. Shooting the bodies would look cool, but I don't want to get that stuff on me. Oh, what about that locked door? I'll make a new door with this baby. Call me Ali Baba! Open sesame! Fine then! Close sesame! Man, three rounds of buckshot point blank. What the hell? It's like one of those doors from Looney Tunes where they blow up the whole building but the door's still standing. I bet it's locked on both sides and nobody has the key. Let's see, can I climb up this? I don't think I can. Those edges are slanted. So, even if I could reach it, I'd just slide right off. You'd think they don't want people climbing the elevator shaft. Well, there's a ladder. I could-- I can jump that. I'm going to need a running start, though. This right here is why you should eat Wheaties in the morning. I guess any breakfast is better for you than the two shots of vodka I had. Whatever, let's do this. Hoogasaka hoogasaka hoo! Oh shit, oh shit, oh shi--! What? What's going on? I-I fe...I feel weird. I don't trust these Doritos. I think I've got bad nachos. How does this happen? There should be enough preservatives in these things to mummify a small dog. I need to find a phone so I can call their hotline. Tell 'em I've got bad nachos. And the building's being attacked by aliens. Eh, I'll just stick with nachos. Man, I'm getting déjà vu. Where am I going? Well, there can't be anything good in that office if that guy was diving out of the window. I guess that means I have to take the elevator. I guess that means I have to take the elevator! God dammit. This is exactly why you have stairs! Stairs without turret guns! Now why is there no ladder here? The other shaft had a ladder here. It was progressive. Well, there's a ladder on the other side. Oh, it's some sort of new age Chutes and Ladders design. So, my only way out of here is to take some flying leap of faith. Like that scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Then claw like a mad cat and hope like hell, I get a grip, and don't break my ribs. Once again, I need a grappling hook. I can't believe this. Why do you have a ladder in an elevator shaft? To fix the elevator. How do you get to the ladder? You take the elevator that doesn't work! Who thought this one up?! Jesus Christ! I suppose I could do the math on whether this jump is feasible or not, but, y'know, I'll have plenty of time for that when I'm dead. Urf. OH MY GOD! That was stupid! Why do I keep doing stupid things? Oh my God...oh... I could've died! Oh, cry me a river! I just jumped across an elevator shaft onto a ladder, and I'm still here! Do I look like Spiderman to you? No! If I was Spiderman, I could do that web-flinging crap and have been out of here hours ago. The point is, you can learn how to do a pull-up. Although, I'll admit, these ledges suck. I don't understand how--Whoa! You might want to g-- Never mind. But yeah, I don't understand why these ledges are so damned small. There's like just enough room to inch along here. These things are designed for Oompa Loompas. I bet that's how management thinks the elevators run. A bunch of Oompa Loompas inside the shaft, singing while they move ropes and pulleys. What the hell, what the hell, what the hell...? These ledges don't even reach the floor the elevator's stopped on. What's the point of even having them? And why are they sloped downward? As the professor showed us, it's easy enough to die without the extra help. Like this! Huhh...thank you for not collapsing. Though, I can't say I was too worried about that, seeing as how the other guy was doing a flexed-armed hang here for at least five minutes. What was he doing there? Is anyone hiding up there? No... Well.... Eh, too bad nobody's inside. I bet I would've scared the crap out of them. Okay, this door better open or else I'm going to kill somebody. All right! Now, nobody needs to die unless I think of another reason. Oh, I like this solid hallway with no ledges. Y'know, I think I just don't feel like climbing anymore. Yeah! Kick his ass! No, you're doing it wrong! Huh? Yeah! Shoot it! Aww... You people never fail to disappoint me. Why was that guy screaming about the silo door? It's closed. Well, that shotgun's mine. Oh, come ON! There's extra ammo there and everything. Well, I guess out of the whole facility, the security station is the one place that should have bulletproof glass. But still, I could argue that I have more need for a shotgun now than any other time in my life. Though, it wouldn't be the first time I've said that. Why is this guy dead? He wasn't dead a minute ago. He was screaming about silo doors like a possessed farmer. Did the laser kill him? Are these death lasers? They can't be that potent; his body's not on fire. I'm going to touch it. Well, that didn't hurt. What's going on? Ah-ah! Of course! A machine-gun turret. Silly me, I forget how we need these things. Yep, somewhere some manager's feeling like less of a man unless he buys more turret guns. Ow! I can't even see what I'm shooting at. Ow! Shit! Fuck! This is worse than paintball! Oh, great timing. Huh, well, at least it's nondiscriminatory in what it shoots at. All the more reason NOT TO HAVE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE! Oh, and what's this? A dead soldier! This is exactly what I said was going to happen! Dead rescue team! That'll teach you to beep at me. I break alarm clocks, I can break you, too. So, what's the story on this guy? Yep, deader than a dead dead guy. Is that an MP5? It is! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Now I can solve up to 800 problems a minute. A submachine gun. It's not just for party tricks. Allow me to demonstrate! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha... That's right, short controlled bursts. The candle that burns twice as bright lasts half as long. Y'know, it's a marvel of science, but this random teleportation thing is getting old real fast. Jesus Christ! Just keep them coming, why don't ya? Now, what is this? I'm not sure, but I'm finding that crossing these lasers doesn't lead to anything good. Hup! And another! I can limbo this. I thought I shouldn't be able to see the laser beam; it had to be smoky or something. Hm. Oh, goodie. Another dead guy. I'd better conserve on the MP5. C'mon! Fucker... Ah-ha-ha-ha. Hey! I think that intercom said 'Turret maintenance to center command'. Yeah, I bet they have a few questions to answer. Like, why are our turret guns killing off everyone in the building? Man, they knew what they were doing when they built this suit. I must've taken a dozen bullets and it hasn't even punctured it. I'm really wishing I'd found that helmet. Okay, let's NOT trip this laser. No! Shut up, shut up, shut up! Stay on your side of the line! My roommate in college used to do the same thing. If I had a gun then, I'd-- What did I just say?! Huh?! That's right! Stay on your side. Your side is the one where everyone is dead and there are no exits. My side is the one filled with hope, love and submachine guns. And cargo hooks. All right, is anyone looking? Okay, here we go. Oh, c'mon! Why'd you have to spoil the moment? YOU GUYS HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR ART! CRITIC! You know, we're the ones that invented teleporters... ...I think. The least you could do is show a little appreciation around here. Yuck, I hate to say it, but with all these sentry guns and laser tripwires, I can't shake the feeling that I'm going the wrong way again. I mean, let's face it: you don't put turret guns in the visitor's center. Or the labs. Or any other place you want people to stay alive. Isn't that the point of hiring security guards? They're smart enough to know not to shoot everyone? The crazy thing is, I may have been doing the right thing all along. That turret gun must have mowed down that soldier. I would've been waiting for a rescue team that wasn't gonna make it. Whoa, this is slick. It's like there's oil mixed in or something. Whoa... Oh, oh, nice. Have an empty elevator shaft for me to slide my ass into after hopping over another tripwire. That's great. Oh, I see. That was just one stage of trying to kill me. Uh... hi. Little busy here. Don't try to help me or anything. 'cuz nobody does that. You do that! God, you two are creeping me out. "Come play with us, Gordon. Forever...and ever...and ever..." "The doughn--"? No! I have more important things on my mind. Okay, this is weird. I'm going to need a minute to think about this. Quit staring at me! Yeah, you! All right. I've figured it out. You guys are zombies. Not the horror movie kind, but the honest-to-God voodoo kind. Somebody resurrected you from the dead and he's on his lunch break or something so that's why you're just standing here next to all these lasers and guns. I can't help you guys because your brains are being controlled by somebody else. Oh, yeah, see, there's your master up there. I should go talk to him. Maybe I can buy one of you off him. You could help out around the house or something. Besides, I have a gun. Everything's for sale when you have a gun. I know how to talk to these people; I've been to Haiti. Les yeux de Dieu ne regardent pas beaucoup là. Hey, is that some more ammo? All right! High-five! Well... forget it. I am a little envious of those guys, actually; just standing there next to things that could kill them. I wish I could be like that. Just not care whether I live or die. Considering every retarded risk I've taken this morning, you'd think I don't care, but I do. I don't want to die. I want other people to die FOR me. Ah, the rescue team! Or, um... what? Okay, I can understand shooting someone running at you screaming, but... I dunno, this feels shady. Is there another way out of here? I think this guy's in a bad mood. No... all right, fine. I'll try and go make friends, even though that always ends up the same way. See, he's not even trying to plant a gun on him or hide the body. That's a bad sign. Like this is just another day at work for him. I'll at least give him some warning so I don't sneak up on him. This guy's jumpy. Hey, killer. What's up? God! Jesus! Shit... Dammit. Diplomacy sucks! OW! Man, what's your problem?! And why are you shooting everyone?! I'm taking this gun away from you, mister. You're obviously not mature enough to handle it. Now, you sit there and think about what you've done. Somebody needs to explain what the term "rescue" means to that guy. It does NOT mean whatever he thinks it means. Well, more ammo. I wish I could save all this for a rainy day, but the way this day's going, it must be pouring outside right now. Not that I'd know anything about that; I'm still stuck in these catacombs. So, yeah, guess I just killed a guy. Totally on purpose this time. I'll just keep on moving and not really think about that. Hey, me too, but you go on first just in case they're not cool with that. Yeah, see, I'm just getting some bad vibes here. Is there another floor I can get off on? I think this is the wrong one. No... Well, maybe I'm being a pessimist, but I just don't think I'm going to get along with these guys. It's like a throwback to high school where everyone had their--oh, more ammo-- where everyone had their own cliques and you had to watch what you said to which group. I guess the difference is here there won't be so much drama. We all have guns so we should be able to work out our differences pretty quickly, and won't have to draw this out over the school year. CUT IT OUT! SEE, YOU GUYS PROBABLY NEVER GOT OVER THIS CRAP FROM HIGH SCHOOL! I WENT ON TO COLLEGE! OW! I HAVE A DOCTOR'S DEGREE! You guys are dicks! I know what's going on here. Every one of you wants to be the big hero for rescuing us but you can't decide so you fight over it. Instead of taking turns, you just shoot anyone who walks out the door so that no one else can take credit for the rescue. God damn! Congratulations! You won the prize! You're all dead. Yuck... So, how many people have I killed now? Three or four? I think that one guy killed his buddy with a grenade, which doesn't surprise me at all. Okay, left... right... I'll go this way, I'll just crawl this time. Save my back. I still don't even know what any of these lasers do, just that it's probably not good. I don't think these are like those coupon dispensers at the grocery store. Man, I don't think I want to go this way; I'm just going to turn around. So, yeah. I'm killing people now. But that was NOT murder. That was TOTALLY self-defense. Just because I had a submachine gun doesn't change anything. It just lets me defend more efficiently. I haven't murdered anyone. Err, not today, anyway. All right, where am I going? I think I did a U-turn again; this looks like a dead end. There's no steps, of course. Well this conveyor might go somewhere, but it's going the wrong way. Yeah, I don't wanna--WHOA! Okay, fuck this. There's gotta be another way out of here. Oh, hey, I can just climb up there. Okay... Oh no. So, we going to play nice, or...? Nope. Well, looks like my armor's better than yours. And I'll just loot your bodies because that's how I roll. And that puts me at six or seven counts of self defense. All right. Heeeeyyyyy! "Surface Access"! Yes! Score! Y'know, I think murder used to be legal in Texas, if it was in your house and your wife was having sex with another man. Hm, maybe you had to be drunk, too. They have drive-through beer stands in Texas. I am going to get so drunk tonight. Like, way more than usual. YEAH! IT'S THE SURFACE! PARTY! P-- Dammit! It's the Fun Police! I'M ON YOUR SIDE, YOU FUCKING IDIOTS! HOW MANY OF YOU DO I HAVE TO KILL BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?! GODDAMN, YOU'RE STUPID! YOU'RE LIKE A BUNCH OF LEMMINGS WITH MACHINE GUNS! DO I LOOK LIKE AN ALIEN?! AM I GREEN?! DO I HAVE TENTACLES COMING OUT OF ME?! GIVE ME THIS! AND THIS! Wait, is that a chopper? HEY, HEY, HEY! HHHHEEEELLLLP! HELP ME! WHAT THE FUCK?! WHY ARE WE BOMBING?! THERE'S NOBODY HERE! WHY ARE THE SOLDIERS BOMBING EACH OTHER?! IS THIS REAL?! I JUST WANT TO GO HOME! EVERYONE IS CRAZY EXCEPT ME! AGH! I DON'T UNDERSTAND! WHY IS EVERYONE TRYING TO KILL ME?! I'M AWESOME! ARE YOU ALL JEALOUS?! SHOOTING AT PEOPLE ISN'T VERY NICE! GIVE PEACE A CHANCE! OR AT LEAST, STAND STILL! Oh God, more bombs, more bombs, more bombs... QUIT RAINING ON MY PARADE! THIS IS BULLSHIT! THIS IS WHY WE HAVE A SECURITY DEPARTMENT! AGH! TO PREVENT THINGS LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING! SOMEBODY'S NOT DOING THEIR JOB! Ehhh... THIS IS THE WORST RESCUE OPERATION IN HISTORY! I'M REPORTING ALL OF YOU! I'LL COME BACK AND GET YOUR NAMES ONCE THE BOMBING'S OVER! Climbfastclimbfastclimbfastclimbfast... Okay, anyone following me this time? I'm ready. I'm ready. No... All right. God, I'm back underground again! I COULD'VE BEEN OUT OF HERE! BUT, NO! The fucking Army or whatever is trying to kill me, and they're bombing the surface for no God damned reason! They don't even care if they hit their own troops! I-I just don't understand anything anymore. I just want to get out of here and let everybody else go crazy with each other on their own time. Not mine! What's this? "Vent Access"? Yeah, I don't know if I wanna-- Well, that's nice. Now I have options. I can have death-from-above this way or death-from-above the other way. And there's another bug... Let's see... there he is! That's right, run! RUN! Dammit, this isn't working. See, this is why I needed that shotgun. It has good spread and stopping power. It's practically designed to kill roaches. Wow, what's the point of having an underground bunker if we can just blow a hole in the top? Oh, they're using steel grates here. Not those cheap-ass... aluminum ones I've been running into. Dammit, I don't even want to think about the irony of this. And how I'm trying to go back-- How I'm trying to go back underground even though all I want is to get out of here. Well, actually, I want a lot of things, but number one on the list was getting out of here. But, now that we're blowing up the surface of the Earth, that changes my priorities. This must've been what H.G. Wells was talking about. Maybe half of humanity will go underground and start a new society-- ...careful.... --and enslave the surface-dwellers. That's my destiny. Yeah. I'm a first-generation Morlock. I don't think I'll start cannibalizing people right away, though. I'll at least wait until the vending machines run out. Man, somebody's laughing at me. Perfectly good shotgun ammo and I can't use it. I guess I can't complain. I have other guns, but can you really have too many? Wait a minute... That's that cargo hook I've swung on. I've been here before! All right, all right. Well, I'm just going to keep moving forward. I'm not ready to believe this entire facility is a giant fucking Möbius strip. Maybe I should become a tour guide after this. I'm good at acting like I know where the hell I'm going. "Follow me." RAGH! STOP THAT! YOU CAN'T FOLLOW ME! YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY! THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT! Where the hell did you come from, anyway? Oh... This must be the right way as opposed to my way. Y'know, the thing that bugs me about today is that I seem to be making all the right decisions but my situation has been getting really dangerous. I don't-- Yeah, I guess that's what happens when you shoot everyone on a rescue operation. But, not to worry, I'm a scientist and I'm armed like a secessionist. Hey, that rhymes. AGH! OKAY, FINE! I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU GUYS AREN'T INTO POETRY! I guess I can't completely blame you. That wasn't a perfect rhyme; the syllable count was off. So, what's that make? Twelve... fifteen counts of self-defense with an automatic weapon? I'm losing count and I don't think the cops are going to buy that anymore. I'd better just keep quiet about this when I get out. I'll have to fight my urges to brag about it when I get a new job. Have I been here, too? I don't know. This place starts looking the same after a while. It's just some never-ending fantasy warehouse. No... I want some Cheetos. All right, back in this snake hole. This must've been what it was like for the Viet Cong, underground all the time, crawling around in cramped tunnels, American soldiers shooting at you, bugs... I can't believe it's evening already. Is it Daylight Savings Time? No, wait, that wouldn't affect the sky. I hate Daylight Savings Time. Uh, this way. Daylight Savings Time is just another sanction employed by The Man to keep us down. The Founding Fathers didn't have Daylight Savings Time and there's a reason for that. All right, this looks like a cafeteria, except we're serving up batteries and ammo. That's weird. I still don't know where I am. Never thought I'd say this but I think I have enough bullets for now. And it seems we have an airtight freezer with no way to open it from the other side. Kind of a bad omen. Not to say that anything has been encouraging about this day. And this door's locked. Okay, fuck you too, room. Back to my life as a mole. You know, this might suck. If they ever polygraphed me at another job and ask if I'm a mole at the company, I'll know what they mean, but at the same time, I know I'm going to hesitate or panic or something because I'll be thinking back to right now where I'm spending my whole day crawling underground in the dark and it'll trip up the polygraph. I know it. See, there's another vent. This isn't going to end. Ah, there we go. Y'know, that's not to say that I wouldn't be the other kind of mole, too, but nobody's made me any offers. I would've sold out Black Mesa a long time ago if it meant I could retire early. We have BIG trade secrets. Oh, what the-- Oh... It's those two zombies again! I'm going around in circles! Big circles! This is pathetic. Those two have gotten more done just standing there than I have running all over this facility leaving a trail of bodies. This is horrible. I'm just... gonna get out of here. I wonder what Freud would've said about me about crawling in and out of all these ventilation shafts. Nothing good, I bet. Freud was kind of a nutbar, but you have to give him some props. He had the perfect angle. He made all these theories you couldn't disprove. C'mon! But, yeah, he could say anything he wanted then claim you repressed the memories of what he was talking about. It's an unbeatable strategy. C'mon, c'mon! Oh. Yeah, I wish I had a "theory" like that. You can't get away with that kind of crap in physics. You have to have serious math to back it up. Well, except for the string theory crowd. Those guys are a bunch of cultists. I think Steve and Richard sacrificed goats. That's why they never let me come to their cookouts. They've called the cops on me before. It's too bad I didn't know about all these ventilation shafts earlier. I could've used them to crawl around and scare the hell out of people in their offices. Y'know, just whisper stuff when it's dark and quiet. "I'm watching." Then I can spread some rumor about how some guy got killed there and it's haunted and maybe take the office for myself. It would've been sweet. Oh no... I give up. Guess I'll just die here. Eh, what am I thinking? I can't die here. I'll get hungry. I'll wander around some more and if it gets really bad, I'll use one of those grenades to blow a hole in the building. It'll take out this vent, at least. Oh, I know where I am. I'm above the concrete corridor. That clears things up. Rrrr! This sucks! An alligator could bite through this. I wonder if I bought a baby alligator and fed it and gave it water, how long could it survive in these air ducts. That would be a good experiment. I'll try that at the next place I work at. I'm lost again. Guess I'll go this way... Uh-oh! Blood. Better get ready. [gasp] The shotgun! Wuh! How did you get in here?! What...? What the hell is that supposed to mean? I don't care about any of this. WHY?! You can trust all of us. I don't trust you at all. You appeared here like some magical genie out of a lamp. I don't understand why-- What? Where? There's nothing here. You're crazy. You're just like everyone else here. And where did that security guard go? I didn't see him. He's off playing with that alien in this giant funhouse of a ventilation system. At least this shotgun won't deceive me. It's filled with pellets, not lies. NO! Do you know if leptons are really compound particles? Friggin' doughnuts... Friggin' doughnuts... Beep. Oh. This must be what that guy was screaming about. He would've wanted me to press that button. Hey, you're not really a genie, are you? You're not dressed like one. I asked because earlier I wished for a shotgun and now I have a shotgun. But if that was one of my three wishes, I don't want to waste-- God! Sorry! Sorry... I-I'll just go, okay? I'm going. Sorry... God... Well, I can forget about my other two wishes now. I'm never going to own a water park. Ah well. I don't think he was a genie anyway. You can't trust anyone. Ah hah! Wood is not bullet proof. Yeah. See, the quality of my life is going straight up now that I have a shotgun. I knew this would happen. What the hell is that noise? It sounds like somebody is frying bacon and smacking their head against the pan. Will you cut that out? Oh, it's not you. It's you! But, you're closer. Oh, did he stop? Nope. Cthulhu dog... Y'know, Cthulhu is supposed to be really big. Frankly, I'm quite disappointed. So, what was that guy saying was happening? That this is a military coverup? What is he smoking? Does he realize how impractical that would be? This facility's huge! We must hire almost a thousand people. You can't track down every single-- And aliens! We've got aliens popping up out of nowhere. Think people won't notice that? What are they going to do, say they're all mutant prairie dogs? Shoot everyone in New Mexico? Hey, a grenade! Well, I'll take one more. "Explosives". Whoa! That is a lot of explosives. And that is, what, an oxygen tank? Boy, if I dropped a grenade here, I might be able to make my own exit out of this building. But, I'd probably just die, so... So, what did that do? Beep beep beep. It's the same old story. Oh no. Not down again. Well, I like how at least the lights are red. It's letting me know ahead of time I'm descending into Hell. This whole facility's designed to keep me down. Gravity is so biased. I don't see a vent. The building better not start dropping facehuggers on me again; that was really uncalled for last time. Work it. Whoa! This one drops fast! I bet if I jumped now, I'd break my legs landing trying to catch up with it. When I build a house, I want an elevator just like this. The servants can use the stairs. Don't look at me. You're not worthy and it's better you learned your place in life. What is this, a train track? Car? Does this work? Hey! This is great! No, no, NO! God, why does this always happen? Whenever I'm having a good time, somebody has to go out of their way to ruin it! This is the same crap conductors had to go through in the 1800s! NOTHING CHANGES! I understand I have to fight for what's mine, but why is it ALL THE TIME?! How do I stop this? No...! Bad...! Stop beeping at me! This is all your fault! You're a bunch of Mexican jumping beans! Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep-- Yeah, I'm going to go crazy doing that. This must be why the railway industry died off. They would always crash into ponds of green... radioactive... crap... What? Ah, a radioactive spill. Part of me wants to believe we're not THIS criminally incompetent, but I know better. Oh, man, listen to that... I don't want to go this way... I better get a checkup after this... Eh, I'm being squeamish about this. I have my suit on. It'll protect me. I'm just missing the helmet. So, worst case scenario, we're only talking brain cancer. I can live with that. Actually, that's kind of the point, I CAN live with-- God damn! Get a handkerchief! Snot monster! That's your new name. But, yeah, unlike my colleagues, I seem to have a tendency to stay alive. Since this morning, I've been bitten, shot, bombed, electrocuted, almost drowned, almost fallen to my death, and strangled. Rasputin wasn't so lucky. But here I am, exposing myself to radiation. Why not? Let's add to the list. Maybe I can get burned, stabbed, and poisoned before the day's done. This is another dead end. Or maybe it's just flooded by radioactive green crap. Oh man, I wonder this is that same spill from this morning. That could be seeping everywhere! I'm not going to drink from the water fountains anymore. Oh, hey, this is smart. This is a great idea! Yeah, let's crawl into this drainage pipe! How could this NOT be the right way? Actually, I always wished I could just hop in a giant pneumatic tube that would take me from my home to work, or to the liquor store, the pharmacy, chemical supply warehouse... it would be really efficient. I am a gopher! Oh, no, dammit! Snot rag... NONE OF YOU ARE HOUSEBROKEN! I wonder if this is what being a dog catcher is like. Actually, I don't think they get shotguns. You probably have to provide your own. God... more?! Eugh! This is a pet-trainer's nightmare. You try and get it to behave and all it does is puke snot on you and moan. This looks promising. I'd like to see a dog catcher handle this. If an alien teleported outside, I could call them up and say, "Yeah, I got a dog here. He's real mean." Then the catcher would arrive expecting a dog and get one of these bastards instead. And he can't just run away because-- Dammit. He can't just run away because technically his job is animal control, and this is an animal. It would be better if you could get some kids out on the street watching him so it guilts him into wrestling with the thing. Man, I'd videotape that. This is a lot of radioactive crap. I bet some people would pay money to get bit a radioactive alien. Not me! I know better! That always-- pissed me off about Spider-Man, how he got... NO! BAD THING! BAD! ...how Spider-Man got super powers by bitten by a radioactive... ...spider. That is such bullshit. For starters, the odds of a random mutation being beneficial are astronomical. But, more importantly, even if you did get one, you'd still have radiation poisoning. Comic book writers know about as much about science as I know about... ...well, I'm not a good example since I know almost everything, but... the point is, they could try harder. Hey, I'm up higher. I wasn't even paying attention. I wish I could just will myself out of here like-- Daah! I hate awkward pauses like this. Of course, I'm the one who has to break the ice. I have to do everything around here. Stop that! Ah hah hah hah! Today's lesson is on muzzle energy and momentum. Wow, that was fun. This might my second calling after physics--shooting stuff? I don't want to join the military, though, because there would always be someone giving me orders telling me what to shoot. And they'd want me to lose my beard. Fuck that. I don't get what the big deal is with that. Soldiers had beards in the Civil War, it worked for them. Oh, I see you. WHOA! COMBO PLATTER! Hope I don't need to go that way. I wasn't really expecting that to happen. I DO need to go that way. Hey! You're hiding! I play hide-and-go-seek for keeps. You should've picked a better spot. No one hides from me. Wow, those snot freaks have good eyesight. God, I can barely see it. Come on! I need a scoped rifle. See, I'm behind the curve on this stuff because I've never tried to kill the president. I've never wanted to. Because I know as soon as I did, they'd just replace him with somebody else, so it's like, what's the point? Yep, this is the work of that same catwalk contractor. Okay, I can jump this. I'm flying on the wings of radiation. Yeah. I wasn't worried about not making the jump, but I honestly thought the platform might collapse from under me. That's the kind of day this has been. RRRRR! NO! GOD DAMMIT! THERE'S NOT EVEN A DOORKNOB! Wait, what's that? What? I thought I heard somebody tapping out Morse Code. Why do I care? I don't even know Morse Code. Ngh. It switched back... Who are you? YAH! Yuck. God, what is that noise? It sounds like the drummer to some shitty garage band. Man, I'm getting old. This modern day music just sounds like noise to me. "Bang bang bang." It doesn't even have a beat. I know! This music sucks, right? Don't worry, I'll go make them turn it off. It's ridiculous. Yuck. God, that's a lot of meat there. I wonder how much these things can hold. Like, if I could a herd a cow in here, would it be able to lift it all up and eat it? It's worth finding out. Are you the one making all that noise? MONKEY ON A STICK! WE'RE GETTING FINGERED BY GODZILLA! FUCK! Nnnnghh... Okay, I was waiting for an opportunity to use this. And here it is. It's obvious. A HANDFUL OF SHRAPNEL MAKES THE MEDICINE GO DOWN! That'll teach you from making so much noise. You're lucky I don't call the cops, banging around like you're more important than me. What's this? "Test Fire"? Yes! Damn...! I should get out here, I really wasn't ready for this. I was expecting some shitty drummer practicing, or maybe some scientist into indie music playing some weird-ass whale song remix, but not this. This is even worse. That's not a rope. You can't fool me. Agh, God! Jesus... It's all over me. That's right, the old layer was starting to dry, better baste a new layer of blood on me. It's important to I maintain a fresh coat of blood on me at all times. Helps my sheen. I'll say anything damned thing I want. Whoa. Don't light a match. I'm behind you. OH! Shit...! I'll just... Yeah, I'd better chill here for a minute. I'm going to need some earplugs. Man, I'm a VIP, I don't have to take this. Hey, your buddy's dead, but I didn't do it, so that means you're a witness if somebody asks about it later. That guard's just standing there. I don't know why. Maybe it's his job to guard the explosives from being eaten by aliens. All things considered, I think we should let the aliens eat the explosives if they want to. Hah! I flanked you. Well, I'm going to assume that because this is the most dangerous-looking thing I've seen in my life, I'm going the right way. God! Look at how big this thing is! This is completely unacceptable. We don't have room for this. That thing's already half-buried in the floor. That's right. I bang, you bang, we all bang together. What was that Nietzsche said? "He who fights drummers "should see to it that "in the process he does not "become a drummer?" Or was it "monsters"? I don't know. Same thing, really. No, it had to be "drummers". That's a monster and there's no way I'm going to end up look like that thing. I wonder if Nietzsche was in a band. I bet he was. I should look him up when I get out of here. I bet the songs have pretty deep lyrics. Ho! Huh, twice in a row. I feel like I should be learning something from this. And, of course, the catwalk folds like cardboard, but the frigging pipes are fine. I'm awesome. Hey, there's that other ledge! If I had a hang glider, I could've just swooped down here. And that ledge, too! That would be sick! This place frustrates me to no end. I guess the light at the end of the tunnel here is that it should be pretty easy for me to get a new job now. Seriously, the military is going to get a hard-on once they realize they have honest-to-God monsters that big to attack. The US is certain to dump boatloads into defense spending on top of what we already have. There's going to be a lot of trickling down to research and development. Hell, I could be driving a Porsche before the year is out. Piece of crap. I guess the big danger to such massive defense spending is that we might end up as a military city-state perpetually at war with aliens. Like "Starship Troopers". What's that noise? Oh, someone thinks they're smarter than me, huh? I don't need to dignify this. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A DEGREE! Actually, your host bodies have degrees around here, but you're just latching on to that. That's even worse than one of those online degrees. You're a parasite in every way. Oh. Safety bars. Knowing this place, that means somebody must've fallen in at one point. And we put up cardboard tubes wrapped in tin foil apparently. This is so cool, it's just like Super Mario. I like Mario. It's a game that glorifies the fat blue-collar worker. People will have to learn to appreciate their station in life once I rise to power. What is this place? Oh, I hate forks like this! Because I know whichever path I take, it's going to change my life forever. Okay, did I pick the right one? I did NOT. Shit. Now I'm always going to be 10-seconds behind in life. That means I may miss meeting my future wife or escaping an assassin's bullet. I'll be without a throne or heir all because of this stupid dungeon. This is so unfair! I AM DESTINED FOR GREATNESS! I'll show everyone... Y'know, it would make this whole day almost worth it if I found buried treasure here? I mean, this is the place for it to be. Either that, or some bodies. Oh, cool, I didn't go in circles again. Okay, going to have to hook my arm here... There we go. Yah. Whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm supposed to be the stalker, not you! Get off my turf! Perfect. I mean, what the hell? You sneak out of the manhole and somebody's already waiting for you. Eh, I'm good. I will say, with as many grenades lying around as I've seen, I am a little surprised we haven't had a bigger accident before today. Oh, come on. Man, when I get a mansion, this is exactly what it'll be like. People will knock on the door, the butler will answer the door, blow them away with a shotgun, then close the door. And I guess I'll need a couple people to move the bodies so they don't rot on the property. I can't realistically expect the butler to--where am I? I can't expect the butler to do that by himself without dragging them, and that would mark up the floors. And if it was a really fat guy, they might need a hand-trolley. Yeah, I don't know, there's a lot of planning involved, I'll just have to take this one step at a time. This room reminds me of that place in Star Wars where Darth Vader cuts off Luke's hand. Man, I wish lightsabers were real. I don't see why you need "the Force" if you have an energy sword that can cut through anything. All you need then is a list of demands. Damn, I was hoping for a maintenance shaft here. What's this do? Nothing? There's really no excuse for hav-- Urgh... OW! JESUS CHRIST! THAT COULD'VE TAKEN MY HEAD OFF! WHO THE FUCK DESIGNED THIS?! How are you supposed to turn that on without dying? How are you even supposed to turn it off? Is that what all these grenades are for? I guess I don't have anyone to blame but myself. You go around pushing enough buttons on heavy machinery and you end up in trouble. At least there were no witnesses this time. I mean this is nothing compared to wood shop back in high school. I almost got expelled over that. What? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! YOU CAN'T OPEN THIS FROM THE INSIDE AND IT AUTOMATICALLY SHUTS?! I think there needs to be a sign on the outside that says "Please prop the door or else "you'll die a slow death." I wonder if the aliens are edible. Hey, it's getting kind of drafty in here. I can barely hear myself think. Oh, yeah, that's a breeze all right. I wonder how far I can make my spit go if I was to hock a loogie into the... no, better not. Too bad the bodies landed on the other side of the door, then I could just toss them in and watch them explode. COME ON! THIS IS STUPID! Huh? What about the keypad? Yeah! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-- OOF! How is this happening...? Just let me out of here... Jesus Christ... This must be a windspeed of 150 miles an hour... Stop persecuting me... all of you... Stop... stop... I guess now I know why that door wouldn't open. That must be why those boards were up there, too. Shhh. This must've happened before. I bet they used to have it lined with spikes. Then, one day they came in and found the janitor impaled on the ceiling. I mean, my God, I'm not even wearing air-resistant clothing. I thought you had to be wearing MC Hammer pants and a poncho for that to work. You don't deal with this in theoretical physics. It's just numbers, but rocket scientists don't have that excuse. They have to test the rockets, no matter how many people get killed. But I respect that. You know? Huh?! DO YOU PEOPLE HEAR ANYTHING I'M SAYING?! I DON'T THINK YOU DO! "Oxy"? Is this oxycodone?! Oh, no, it's probably just oxygen. I don't think you can get high off oxygen; it just makes you more alert. I don't really know what I'm doing, but, y'know, pushing buttons and having it do something is sort of its own reward. Not that I don't have better things to be doing with my time. I need to start looking for a new job and get cracking on that lawsuit. I've got shit to do! God dammit! This is that door that wouldn't open! I'VE GONE IN CIRCLES AGAIN! Actually, I don't feel like looking for a new job. I want to go on vacation like Hawaii or some place in the Caribbean. Actually, what I really want is a rebreather so then I can tame a giant sea turtle and learn how to ride it. Once I can ride a sea turtle, that opens up some options. Then I can come up on cruise ships undetected and shoot tranquilizer darts at the passengers. That'd be fun. Actually, if I had some ninja claws, I could scale... the side... of the boat... and then come aboard at night and rob people. I mean, y'know a cruise ship would be loaded with loot. And I'd have the perfect getaway vehicle: my sea turtle. Hell, I could get the vacation to pay for itself. I think I'd name the sea turtle "Flippy". That's a good gender-neutral name. Or maybe I'd call it "Whiskers" as a joke, because that's what you'd name a cat. The cruise ship guests would think that's pretty funny until I pulled a gun on them. Wow, you might be a reptile but you're really dangerous. You're not like a turtle at all. I don't like that. God, how can this thing just shrug off a grenade? It should kill anything. God, STOP BANGING! JESUS! You know, some cultures sacrifice people to volcanoes or whatever. I'd sacrifice people to this thing if it would keep it quiet. Man, now it's blocking the way I want to go. I have no sympathy for this thing whatsoever. God! Yeah, that's right! You show that metal floor who's boss! Don't take "no" for an answer! Yeah, they'll be handing out defense contracts like candy once they see a monster that's immune to grenades. Money money money. Man, between suing Black Mesa and being in a key field for a new job, I might be able to fund building a robot army like I always wanted to. Dammit, I can't jump this! Jackie Chan couldn't jump this! Well, maybe he could if he kicked off from wall to wall, but I'm not that good. Ah, see, if I had a grappling hook, I could throw it up there and swing across. Maybe. Maybe it's just as well I don't have a grappling hook. Oh, what am I saying? Of course I want a grappling hook, or a harpoon or something. Of course, the real problem here is that Earth's gravity is just too damned high. See, case in point. If I was on Mars, I wouldn't even have to think about this gap, but as it stands, I'm like a monkey trying to decide whether he can reach the next branch or not. It's a wonder we've even made it this far. We should've all fallen from trees and be extinct right now. Okay, focus. Don't die. Don't die. Hup! Oh God. Don't want to do that again. This would be more fun if I was an adrenaline-junkie. Oh, now I know I'm going the right way. Right. Jesus Christ... If you think I won't shoot you in the back you're mistaken. Okay, everybody's dead. Just the way I like it. God, my knees are shaking from going across those gaps. You'd think I'd be getting used to doing leaps and edging my way along ledges but there's always that chill knowing that if I make one small mistake, I'll be dead within seconds. I'm not used to performance reviews like that. Okay, so I should NOT shoot the gas canisters with a shotgun. I think I'm getting it. I'm starting to see how someone could go crazy down here. I'm seeing monsters as big as a building, ones that teleport out of the air, soldiers trying to kill me, a giant building with no exits, a crazy-o-meter... But see, now it's kind of peaceful and quiet, and it makes me wonder if I'm just imagining everything. But no matter how sane or rational I think I am, I'M STILL STUCK IN THIS BUILDING! Oh. Good. Perfect. Yeah, see, this is what I'm talking about. Everything's fine then chirping maggots with legs start popping around the corner. That's crazy. I'm not crazy and I know that's crazy. Yeah, that's right, moan! MOAN! That noise is exactly what I'll be thinking about when I try to go to sleep tonight. And I'll be dreaming about you sucking out my eyes with your tentacle face, while I'm nestled up against a stack of rotted corpses, then my intestines will burst with insects crawling out of them, then the screaming--jeez, that's a long drop. Uh huh. That's it. I'm going to order a grappling hook when I'm get out of here. This is never going to happen again. Huh. Wow. A drop this deep really makes you wonder about the necessity of having a chamber this size. It's just as well that green goo is down there. If I thought it was water, I'd be tempted to just jump off here and do a cannonball. I bet I could get a splash two stories high. Is that a pixie? Science hasn't disproven the existence of pixies. If they can shift through dimensions, that would explain the lack of evidence for them. What's this? I'm hearing clicking. Pixies don't click. Is that you? No. Hey, lights. What? Who did the--? Oh. Good! I can get out of here! Hey, wait. That's not a pixie. That's just some blue light. This whole place is built on deception. Screw it. Going up. No! Going up, dammit! That's where I came from! UP! Argh! This is going to take for-- I guess I spoke too soon. Uh. Jesus! I don't like this... Okay, I'm in a rickety-ass elevator that's creaking. What do I do? Get off it? Okay, that looks like a pipe. Looks like it might go somewhere. Don't think I have a lot of options. Okay, I-I can jump this. And the irony is, it's probably going to be one of the safer jumps I've done this morning. Assuming I don't die. Oh, man! I climbed my way to safety! I AM A MONKEY GOD! That could be me right now, a toxic human french fry. But no, my simian skills saw me safely. Hey, did you see that? Look at me! Look at me! Smithers went down there and Oh, you think he escaped? All right, here's the plan: you keep staring at your dials and I'll get out of here. I mean, I wouldn't come back for you if I found an exit. That's not my job. Ah, tick-tick-tock. Is that the sound of a Geiger counter or is my lifespan counting down? It's both! That's right, here at Black Mesa, when we talk about half-life, we mean it more ways than one. So, make your peace and come to Black Mesa. Here, you'll win a chance to fight freaks of nature, escape countless safety hazards, wander aimlessly for hours, and die scared, tired and alone. Where's that noise coming from? Yeah, I'm calling you out, noise. Oh, it's you. This is almost getting to be like a chore. Y'know, wash the dishes, do the laundry, shoot the snot thing, empty the trash... It's all just a blur. What's this do? WHOA! Nnnnnnyyyeeeeow! That was awesome, let's do it again. AGAIN! AGAIN! Eh, no, better not. I could do this all day. I'm never going to rich enough to buy my own island if I keep this up. Wow. Yeah, it's like that experiment with rats, where every hour they're given the choice between food or having the pleasure center of their brain stimulated and the rats starve to death every time. Hup! You know, that first ride was fun but this one looks kind of dangerous. It's just slamming back and forth. Whoa-ho. Yeah, you can feel THAT passing. That'll knock your head off like one of those little tee-ball sticks. That's snap, crackle, and pop all in one package. Ah, a button. Well, my work here is done. Hey, are you a monkey, too? spot, and I'm not moving has drastically improved. And don't tell anyone I'm here! Okay, I'm going to call you Mr. Fantastic. Or wait, no, Doc-Doctor Amazing. Doctor Amazing. Ah hah. Well, that was anticlimactic. I was hoping that some music would start playing if I pressed both of them. Y'know, it would be cool if we could get a dance party going on up here, like a rave? I bet the acoustics of this room would be interesting. What?! Man, you're not going to be missed. Nobody's going to come looking for you. Uh...wait a minute. Okay, we're not electrocuted... I've determined that much... but... um... not seeing a way down... now... Umm... shit. I think I fucked up. I think I fucked up, man. I... shouldn't... press buttons without... knowing what they do first... Oh, oh, okay. We can get down-- I mean, I can get down here. Okay, I'll just lower myself down and be careful about the landing. Oooh... okay... um.... that's pretty scary... Yaaahh....! God dammit, Earth's gravity shouldn't even be this strong for a planet our size. It's only this way because there's so many metals in the core increasing its overall density so that-- Oh fuck, I'm going to have to jump here. Okay, lower myself down... to reduce the VERtical... drop...! Now, time it so I don't get sideswiped by the cart of death... And... Aaagh... rrr... Okay... Yeah... I'm just going to take it easy. God, that would've been so much easier if I was drunk. I mean, not piss-drunk, but y'know, just like a heavy buzz. I would've been fearless, wouldn't have hurt my knees at all. This sucks sober! Life sucks sober! Oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God...oh God... Okay, I think coming this way has the biggest waste of time I've accomplished in a while. That's saying a lot. I mean it's not like I just went down the wrong corridor, like I sometimes do. No, it's--WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! It's worse than that. Hey, that looks kind of cool. I want a giant metal spider fortress. What was I thinking about? Oh yeah, this place sucks. How could I forget? Yeah, when I go down a dead-end here, I go down a DEAD-END! Meaning, I go off course for, like, miles, ten stories underground, and I almost die. A lot. Yoo-hoo! up again in no time! Yeah, that room's dangerous. Did you know that? It's a good thing I made it back okay. I was gonna... yedduh... yes, master... No, stop! You can't kill me, so you're going to try and control me, IS THAT IT!?! I'LL NEVER DO YOUR BIDDING! I HAVE A DOCTOR'S DEGREE! Wait, how am I going to get out of here? I should've thought about this sooner... I still don't even know what this chamber is for. I don't think I can climb those beams; there's no grip. Oh, I know what this is like. It's like a giant esophagus. So, I guess this would be the stomach. Because this could be acid. I don't know what it is. So, if that's the stomach, then where's the... Hey, what's this? A ladder! While, I'm 100% in favor of having a tomb this size devoted to me, I shouldn't be put in it until after I'm dead. You don't bury the pharaoh alive. That's what the help is for. So, if those other guys want to stay down there and die to honor my future burial site, I guess that's okay, but it's still a little premature. It would be better if they were locked in and died as I was being buried. Man, this is a long climb. How much farther is it? Man, y'know, on second thought, I'm not sure I want to be buried here. I mean, yeah, the chamber's big, which is good, but it's all underground; nobody's going to see this. And there needs to be statues carved of me. And murals. They have the right idea with the Lincoln Memorial. None of this abstract crap like the Washington Monument. I want everybody to know it's me! Dammit! How am I going to get over there? Oh, is this a ledge? No, not really, but it'll have to do. Jesus Christ, this is not a lot of room. Why is there a ladder here if this is the only way to access it? God, that was almost as bad as the other elevator shaft. The one before this one, I think. The one where the guy died. I mean, the one where the guy died that wasn't the first one where the other guy died. I-I mean, the one where the other GUYS died. I think that's the one. That one sucked. Aaaaa! Yow! YiyiyiyiyiYIYIYIYIYI! Yeah, I don't know. I've been up and down so many elevators, I'm kind of losing track. Something is happening. Y'know, I don't remember having horrible electrical shocks going through here the first time. I do remember being in pain, though. I mean, I'm not sure it was this exact same location, but that's been pretty consistent. In fact, if you were to sum up this whole day in just one word, it would be "pain". Or maybe "doom". Or maybe just "bang". I guess that your vote. I guess your votes are for "dead". Though, I don't like "dead". I think it sends the wrong message. Oh, God! Not this again! Okay, I'll just go slow and face the wall so if I slip, I'll have another chance to... No... No, no, no... Okay, that's enough of that. I never need to do that again. Oh, jeez. This is the one that's really bad. You know, I don't think of myself as being afraid of heights, but look at this! It's DEEP! All right, all right, all right... all right.... all right..... all right...... Raaneeh! OKAY! I ROCK! NOW STOP MAKING ME PROVE IT! THAT WAS NOT COOL! God dammit, this thing's blocking me again! What's your problem?! Did you see that jump I made?! Here, just move! No.... Okay, I can see there's no reasoning with you. You're going to throw a fit, fine! You know, this is what counseling is for, but I just don't have time for this. Here! This is ridiculous. You know, that was my last grenade. Not that I expect you to care about my feelings. God, shut up! Just shut up! I don't-- I'm not talking to you. Hey, it just occurred to me. What if that's only part of--WHOA! Yeah, that's close enough. What if this is the monster's hair strands or something? And the rest of it teleported inside the Earth? It's wearing me and this entire facility as a hat. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I wouldn't go so far and say I feel dirty, but it's strange. Yeah. Yeah, see that moaning doesn't help anything either. I mean, what's your motive here? That's the real question, isn't it? All you're giving me is this banging and moaning. I'm just not ready for this. I never should've got involved. I just want to get out of here. Whoa, whoa, what's this? Are you kidding me? Are we using tape reel computers? No.... Wait, are those slots for punch cards? Shut up! No! I'm not listening to any more of this. Hey, the lights are on. Hey, it's doing something. Did somebody fix this? Wait, what did I just do? Oh! YEAH! THAT'S RIGHT! IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT, GET OUT OF THE ROCKET PROPULSION TEST CHAMBER! AH HAH HAH HAH! BURN! BURN! Burn! Physics rules! Yuhh... It smells like butt-rock in here. I'm leaving. Oh, wait, I can't go back. They're bombing. I know what, I'll go and ask that security guard if he knows how to get out of here. Come to think of it, I'm not sure why I didn't do that in the first place. Ehh, I guess we were both kind of distracted. What? Did that collapse under its own weight? I've made stronger pillow forts than that! Though, to be fair, my pillow forts were pretty bad ass. I used to soak them in plaster of Paris and would let them dry to reinforce them. That sure pissed mom off. But, in the end, I think it was worth it. Where is everybody? Not up there... the guard's gone... I think I remember some explosives here...? Now there's just scorch marks... A blood stain... And this is after... firing... that rocket... Huh... Well, I'll take these grenades anyway. I'm not so upper-class I won't accept grenades in worn condition. They're just going to explode anyway. So, where am I going now? Uhh... Oh, hey, that blew a hole down there. May as well check that out. I'm still not happy with the trend of going down, but, y'know, anywhere's better than here. I think. So, hey, that means that was the whole alien. I was afraid I was going to look down there and see... Hey, that's a ladder. That means this is legit, this might go somewhere. I mean, it probably leads to a room filled with poison gas and a bunch of dead people who look just like me, but I don't KNOW that, so there's room for hope, I guess. But, yeah, I was expecting to look down there and see this giant eyeball looking up at me, angry at me because I blew off its eyelashes or something, then the whole building starts shaking and I guess I'd... just... ball up and cry. Because, what do you do when something that big wants to kill you? I'm used to people being beneath me, in so many ways. God, it smells like ass down here! Maybe I should go back, this is rank! But, then again, I'm not exactly Crescent Fresh myself. Well, this experience is enough to show those chicken people up. I hate those people who say every new meat tastes like chicken. I bet this thing tastes NOTHING like chicken; it doesn't smell like cooked chicken. I bet it tastes like... ...grasshoppers. I haven't tasted it, but this thing smells bad. I'm not going to try it. Oh... oh, that's a drop. Wow, this is really making put my money where my mouth is. Because earlier I said I wanted to do a long drop cannonball if there was water down there. And here it is. Uh... Kind of stupid... But there's a light down there, this could be all right... Let's assess: Cons: I might starve to death where nobody could ever find me. Pros: This could be fun as hell. I'm going to do it. Yeeeeeeeeeeeee...! Oh... radiation... dead bodies... no...! All right! I'm making a lot of progress for not knowing where the hell I'm going. And I can breathe. What more could I want? Whoa. That's a lot of sludge. I guess this way. Wait, this doesn't go anywhere. JESUS CHRIST! Look at how much we're pumping out! This is bad! I thought the other spills were bad, but I also thought they might be kind of contained, like we had some sort of plan if this happened, but this is a river! I'm not a bleeding-heart ecologist, and I've got more pressing things on my mind, but fuck me, if this gets into the groundwater... Well, that's it, we've already been playing crash and burn with this whole facility, but this is us pissing on the ashes as our final tribute to the whole community. I'm getting out of New Mexico. I don't care what the agreement on my lease says. I'm glad I didn't buy a house. Real estate here is going to be a thing of the past once cancer rates explode and two-headed babies start being born. I'll try going this way. This is all even worse than it looks. Because, say we were dumping barrels of pig shit into the groundwater. That would not be good, but at least that's biodegradable and would eventually decompose over time. But, no, look at this. My Geiger counter's ticking and this stuff is fucking glowing. That's radioactive. That's not going anywhere. Radiation is the gift that keeps on giving. Maybe I should just leave the country, go back to Austria. It was nice there. Plus, I swear half the women there look like they could be models. And, of course, there my beard would get the respect it deserves. I mean, look at Freud. He knew what he was doing. Unlike here where nobody has any style and everyone looks the same. Though, I will say that--whoa, long drop. Wow, this place just goes down forever, huh? All right. Yeah, I will say the Einstein hair and mustache look that some people around here are sporting is pretty happening. I thought it was a little weird at first but it's definitely growing on me. Hey, what's this do? I bet Einstein got babes. Huh, nothing apparently. Kind of disappointing, though I guess that's better it detaching the pipe and me plummeting to my death. Oh! Gross! Look at that. You can see the skin on top of it like soup! You know, now that I think about it, the Einstein look is really just the Karl Marx look just without the beard. Hey, another pipe entrance! I am so lost... Oh, I can clear this gap. I'll just get enough speed to go around the side. It'll be just like how I used to pass people in those tube slides as a kid. Nnnnyyyyeow! Awesome. Yeah, what sucked about doing that as a kid was that sometimes there wouldn't be enough clearance between me and the kid in front of me, so I'd come at them full-speed and try to pass, but then we both get wedged in the tube. Then they would get skin-burns from rubbing against the plastic, then they'd start crying, then the teacher would yell at me for not waiting my turn, then I'd get detention... Hey, what are those green lights? Huh, I guess it's residue from the waste. But why aren't the-- Oh, shit, shit, SHIT! Okay. I... aaughh... Ugh... Well, that works. Cool. Our cheap-ass table complements our cheap-ass pipe, because now my knees aren't broken. Huh. Wow. I feel like the universe doesn't know what to do with me, so it's just puking me up from one room to the next. I don't know where I'm getting this imagery exactly, but it feels like my reward for escaping one situation where I could be stranded forever and/or killed, is to enter another room where I face the exact same dilemma. Seriously, for what I've been through today, the next room should contain, like, strippers and party balloons, champagne, something along those lines. See, not gunshots. Hey! You dumb shits are finally attacking the aliens! That's...that's a big one. Y'know what, I'm just going to get out of your way and let you do your job; I have total confidence in you. Go Army! Or Marines! Or whatever you guys are. Not you, God dammit! Spontaneous alien combustion. Works for me. If I could blow people up with my mind, I could solve all my problems in like one day. Okay, maybe not all my problems, but earthquakes were never on the list until today. Whoa, that was close! Okay! God! I'll go another way! Hm, I don't hear any more gunshots. I lied. I don't have confidence in those soldiers. I mean, it took them this long just to figure out that me and the other scientists aren't the aliens. I've heard jokes about military intelligence before, but I just thought they were exaggerations. Wow, that looks hot. I want some marshmallows. What the hell are YOU looking at?! I don't HAVE any marshmallows, and even if I did, I wouldn't give any to you! THEY'RE MINE! EVERYTHING'S MINE! Well, this facility's not mine. I thought I wanted it but now I don't. Ah. See, I had a plan for how to rise up the corporate ladder, too. We promote internally, so I was going to kidnap the wife of the company president, then, as a list of demands, I'd say the manager above me gets, I dunno, $50,000. Uh, hold on. So, then I let him sweat it out for a few days, release her, and then, money or no money, the manager's finished. If he's not arrested, then no way in hell's he's keeping his job with guilt of association like that. Eh, this isn't the right ammo. But, who am I kidding? This company's never going to recover. I wasn't looking forward to kidnapping anyway. I wonder if this was boarded up for a reason. Heeeeeere's Johnny! Hey, how did you get in here? Are you drunk? Oooh... can get the power on, straight to the surface. Are you serious? Wha--where is it? to the generator room, I want to get out of here! So, does this switch do it? What's the procedure here? C'mon! I'm ready to go! Come on... Yeah, okay, I'll take the ammo. Yep, that thing's still scary. C'mon, do any of these do anything? Blood...God dammit....all right. That thing has flamethrowers, doesn't it? Why does it have flamethrowers? Jesus Christ, I think that IS a punch card slot. Eh, I'm getting out of here; that monster's scaring me, and, uh, you...have your gun if it gives you any trouble, so, we're cool. Later! Take it easy. Okay, I think he said that the train needs power. Power. I need power. I have the power to get the power. Because...huh... These things would make cool lawn ornaments. I wonder if I could find a taxidermist that would-- Rumble rubble... rubble rumble. Rubble rumble, rubble rumble. No, dammit! I'm not calling you! What? Where did that come from? It fell from the ceiling. Oh. Boy, you could stash some drugs in there. Mm, I don't see any. Maybe the aliens ate them. Alien sale! Prices are falling. No, wait. It's the aliens that are falling. The prices are-- No, I'm not sure that works. Hmm. Yeah, I think I could talk a taxidermist into stuffing one of these. Just tell them I don't know what it is. I found it hunting. I think it might be a weird kind of rabbit. He might buy it. I dunno. I'm a good liar. Shut up! I don't want your opinion. I wouldn't even be lying, really. Because this is...sort of like hunting. And I really don't know what these things are. Though I do know that they're not rabbits. I'd have to lie about that. Oh. "894GH". That tells me where I am about as much as I already know. Ah. Y'know, I think these doors ARE sealed for a reason. Oh boy. Yeah. God, not on my suit! I just plunged into water at almost terminal velocity! I don't need it getting messed up again! I'm still not crazy about the orange color, but it's a good suit. Oh, are these grenade rounds? What the fuck?! FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME, I'M NOT AN ALIEN! Un-fucking-believable. And here I thought they finally figured that out. That's what I get for giving people ANY credit. I saw them shooting the aliens and not me for once, and I ASSUMED that the military finally got it through their thick-ass skulls which targets they're supposed to shoot at! But, no, no, no, no... That's for smart people like me. I know it's obvious I'm a genius, but is everyone else really this stupid? I don't know, but I do know how to prove who's more dead between us. Ah ah, ah, ah! Why? No, not my suit! THE SUIT DENTS WHEN YOU SHOOT IT, SO STOP SHOOTING IT! I hate you all so much... Well, I guess I'll wait for this to die down... Yep... This thing is still beeping. It won't stop. The others stopped. That doesn't bother so much as the fact that it sprays automatic gunfire at me when it beeps. I can't live with that. Like, literally. I don't know, maybe I can outrun it. I'm a track star. I'm amazing. I'm gonna do it. Pew! Yeah, yeah, yeah! That worked! And you can't chase me because you don't have any legs! La la la la! At least, I don't think it does. No, that would require gyroscopes and it would look more like the Terminator, or something. Which would be sweet, but I don't want that after me. Oh, no, another soldier. Did he see me? Maybe not. Yes! Dammit... That answers that question. Why does everyone here insist on doing things the hard way? They should be doing things my way. Okay, fine! We'll do it your way! There! Are you happy now?! Oh, guess not! Y'know, some people just create their own problems. And you're one of them. And, see, look at this. I've never had any military training so I don't know the correct procedure for these things. But, if I saw my buddy run around the corner then get shot, then I saw my next buddy run around the same corner and get shot, I don't think I'd run around that same corner. But, I use discretion. You're not allowed to have that in the military. WHAT THE HELL?! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! I'm an American! God dammit, it's like, what's the point of being an honest citizen if I'm going to get shot at anyway? Hello? No... This is so unproductive. You fell for that trick again! And again... I guess you guys are learn-from-experience types. Though, that only gets you so far. I bet you guys suck as chess. Just keep doing the same thing until you're all dead. You could never do my job. Ah! Man, if I get indicted once I leave here, this is getting harder and harder to explain. I don't think anyone's going to buy a few dozen counts of self-defense with a submachine gun. I think there's kind of an unspoken rule in our society that if this many people are trying to kill you, you're supposed to be dead. I need to talk to an attorney. Maybe there's some sort of Rambo clause. But, wait, Rambo goes to prison after the first movie. Fuck. What's this do? Oh. Well. Shoot. Um, I'm not jumping this. Why are the controls on and off? They should be up and d-- oh, there it goes. Okay, so do I just hit it real quick? Well, there's only one button. All right, one, two, three--GO! Jesus! This is the complete opposite of handicapped-accessible. Wait, what's with all these lasers? Okay, you I know what to do with. Well, that's one problem solved. Okay, let's try this again. Byzantine lift... One...two...three...GO! God! Okay, get off the lift. That's the first step... ...to...a better life. I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. Lasers! Lasers... Nothing good ever happens with lasers around here. So, I'm just gonna not deal with that. That's my favorite solution to any problem. It's like the classic debate of why measuring the position of an electron changes its momentum and vice versa. The only correct answer is to get drunk and set fire to things. Oh, boy. More of you. These are like squeak toys from hell. Actually, if it wasn't for that shockwave thing they do, they could be useful for a new sport. We could just get a stadium, then release a dozen of them out onto the field, then get a bunch soccer players to run out there and kick them all to death. The team that kills the most wins. Ah-ha! "Power Generator". Hm, I guess we would need an odd number of them to reduce the number of draws. But there's always the problem of what if two opposing teams kill one at the same time? You know, what might work better is to kill them first, then kick their bodies into the field goals and count THOSE as the points. And if you kick it too early and one's still alive, then that's a penalty point. Yeah, this has potential. I'm going to stop by the patent office once I get out of here. Okay, electricity. Kind of scary... ...with the arcs. Yeah, whether it's particle or a wave doesn't really matter. It'll still kill you. Well, this looks like the place. Let's go. Y'know, if I'd have known this thing was broken, I could've saved myself the trouble of killing all those people. Okay, mad dash! Well, at least I'm okay. That's all history needs to remember. Still, this is ridiculous. The soldiers should be fixing the generator, not me. I'm doing their job, again! First, I'm killing everyone for them, now I'm playing engineer. You don't even have a job! You're a vagrant. This place reminds me of the basement of my old apartment that got flooded b-- Uck. Worms. ...got flooded because I did a cannonball to the bathtub... ..caused it to collapse into the floor... Dammit. Stupid worms. I'm leaving! Alright, it's moving. Mission accomplished. If any of these worms get in my hair, I swear to God, I'm just going to freak out. Yeah, worms get in my hair, the power fails, and all the lights go out. Then some old guy with a raspy voice starts laughing and poking me with a stick. That would complete the experience. Why was all this water down here anyway? I'm in the middle of the desert in New Mexico. Does that mean I'm below the water table? If so, good God! How deep am I right now? Okay, I'm going to give this one more shot, then... I don't now what I'm going to do. Work, you antiquated piece of crap. Hey, that did it! Now I can power up the train and leave like--what was that? Oh, my...that's bad. That must be a fuckton of voltage to jump like that. Maybe I can--NYAAAH! God. Yeah, I can't say wearing a suit covered in plate metal inspires confidence if that had hit me. I mean, Jesus, most people hit by lightning survive, but that's because they're wearing rubber shoes and you can see where it exits. But, if that hit me right now, the current would roll around in my body and exit through the top. My head would blow up like a baked potato wrapped in tinfoil. It would pop off like a Pez container. I think I need to go the other way. Actually, if it wasn't me, it would be cool to watch if you got that on film. Their hair might catch on fire and it might look like that scene from Scanners, except this would be the real thing. Then you could sell it as a snuff film and make a bundle of money. I know buyers. Oh, give me a break! Yeah, I should've known better. I fixed the generator. Maybe now they need to come in and break it. Uh oh! Everything's working fine! Better call in the military! Wait, where did they go? I DIDN'T IMAGINE THEM! Hey, there's less lasers now. There's scorch marks. They're gone. Holy shit! These were tripmines! I could've died! Well, glad I didn't touch them. How am I going to get back up? I brush with Death so often, I should start giving him high-fives when I pass. Huh, it's probably the military that put these tripmines here in the first place. And they just go and run into them. I don't get it; they bomb each other, they can't figure out who the civilians are, and they can't duck. Yeah, look, look how easy it is. Power slide! Yeah... I could be a rock star. Though, I... guess I'd have to learn how to play guitar... And why does it wait so long for you to get on here, but up there it's like a sprint? Am I really the first person to notice this? Oh, not this again! Please stop that! Okay, I asked nicely, what more can I do? Who's punching in Morse code? I don't speak Morse code! SO STOP THAT! IT'S RUDE! They're probably talking smack about me on the radio. Well I'm not gonna stand for it! I've worked too hard to get to where I am! I graduated from MIT! MY DIPLOMA'S WORTH MORE THAN YOUR LIFE! Screw this, I'm just going to wait for them to come around the corner again. OH SHIT! Okay, natural selection. The dumb ones are all dead so the survivors are a little bit smarter. Ah hah hah! You asshole. DANCE! Oh, hold on. Let me reload. Thanks. Well, that was a learning experience. And no one got hurt. Ohh... You guys had to ruin the moment. Well, you guys are all bastards anyway, so I guess nothing has really been lost. Yeah, it's strange. I thought I would start feeling weird about killing all these people, but, really, I don't. That's because they're all pricks and deserved to die. I'll make a speech at the funerals if someone wants me to. I have no problem with going up to a grieving widow and telling her I'm sorry for her loss, but her husband was a rat-fuck meathead who tried to kill me for no God damned reason because he was too stupid to learn what the word "civilian" means. If I hadn't put him down, he probably would've come home later and strangled you in your sleep. And not in the kinky way, either. I know how you base wives are. Uh oh. The beeping. Okay... Beepbeepbeepbeepbeep. Beepbeepbeepbeepbeep. Beepbeep--oh, hey, it's down. Hah! I can do your job, too! But I don't like to beep too much. It reminds me of that Muppet. NO RADIOS! That's how The Man finds you. Oh, sweet, a map. Okay, so where am I? Which way's north? Okay, "Maintenance Shaft", that could be anything. Half this building is a maintenance shaft. What's that big room, is that where the monster is? What about this radiation pit? "High Voltage", that has to be where I came from. But, what the hell is with these distances then? Why are parts of this grayed out? Is it haunted? WHY IS THERE NO EXIT ON THIS MAP?! Is there a landmark? This map is bullshit, I'm going to find my own way out of here. That map has to be bogus, it only lists one area as being dangerous. It needs to have, like, thirty. You could even write "Here be dragons" on it and that would almost be more accurate than nothing at all. Yeah, see, it doesn't even list "F-712DH". How could you forget to put that down? I mean, I would've named it "Hell Pit #48", but, if the cartographer doesn't care about that name then who will? I guess they just looked at the AutoCAD layout and took some numbers off of that to feel important. Speaking of which, why do drafters always listen to country music? I never figured that out. What's the correlation/connection there? Is it whiskey? Sounds like someone smuggling an elephant up there. That almost wouldn't surprise me at-- OH COME ON! YOU GUYS ARE SPROUTING UP LIKE WEEDS! Trying to shock me... You know, I'm thinking this suit needs some more rubber. Actually, what would be sweet is if I had a layer of it all around me about six-inches thick. Then I could fall from high distances and just bounce wherever I wanted to. If I had enough rubber, I could fall from almost a limitless height, though I'd have to be careful because the recoil might give me a concussion then. Hey, man, you didn't miss ANYTHING good. You made the right choice staying here. Can do! All right, let me get this sucker fired up, then. Straight to the surface. Do I hit this switch? "Track Power: Off"? What the fuck's that supposed to mean?! Come on, start, START! I TURNED THE POWER ON! God dammit, shit, bitch, fucker... I am not happy right now. Okay. No power. Fine! The cavemen didn't have power. And they had to deal with soldiers with machine guns. And giant aliens with flamethrowers for hands. If they can do it, so can I. Yeah, whatever. But, why did I waste all this time doing-- YOU! You told me to go down there! That, if I turned on the power, everything would be wonderful! You're a liar! I can see why somebody shot you! I'm taking your gun from you. I can use this as a drop weapon if I accidentally shoot a civilian later. All right, so where do I want to go? I want to go up, because I've exhausted every single possible dead end below. Eh, this jump isn't too bad. And, hey, if I miss, it won't kill me. Yeah, I mean, it would hurt, but the only way a fall like that could kill me would be if I landed headfirst so that my body weight snapped my neck. And that could never happen. I'm a cat! Meow. Meow. Meow. Mrrrrooooooooowwwww.... HISS! Okay, I'm just going to slip passed here. And you're not going to hear me because you're too bi--OH GOD! Okay, I'm just going to run now! Because I'm scared! You're big! Running! Ah-ah-ah-ah! HOT! I think I underestimated this thing--door. I can't outrun this, it's got longer legs than me. Much lo--NO! God, this happens every time I get cocky. Somebody like this shows up and I start wishing I hadn't said a lot of things that I did. Hey, is that a switch? Maybe if I press it, it'll beep and distract this...guy...from me. Or, I could just walk back and forth in this cramped hallway for the rest of my life. That's a viable option. HEY, GET AWAY FROM THERE! THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU! Did I even do anything? Yep! This is like that trick where the guy runs around on stage spinning plates on sticks. Uhhh... OW! Shit. That did not make a beeping noise. OKAY, THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH! Back, back, BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK, BACKBACKBACKBACKBABABAYIYIYIYIYI! YES! I MEANT TO DO THAT! WHOO-HOO! Big reptile thing stomping around like he owned the place. Well, that's why the dinosaurs went extinct: Me! The bigger they are, the cooler they are to kill. Y'know, I'm an expert on electricity --on the atomic level, anyway-- and this to me looks like the power's on. A bit more dramatic than what I was expecting, but still, on. I'm going back up to that train room and finding out what the hell's going on here. That guard wasn't telling me the whole story. What he meant was: "Hey, yeah, all you have to do is pump out "all that bilge water in the generator room, "turn the power on to the generator, "shoot everyone in sight, "then come back on and turn on the DC generator, "then go down to the storage room and roll a spool up here, "then bust out some pliers and electrical tape so you can lay down some HV cable, "then, just bust through a wall and wire up a new circuit, "then do the same thing on the other end of the complex, "and, yeah, you'll have that train running within the month." Of course, the real tragedy here is that I didn't bring a camera. If I had been taking pictures, I'd be ready when I had to sit through some family member's slideshow. I could whip it out and be like, "Fuck you! Your pictures suck! Look at mine! "There's me blowing up some bipedal alien the size of a dump truck, "Here's me shooting some troops because I'm hardcore." Yeah, I think we're done here. You brought this on yourself. Oh! What's this? "Power: On"! It's alive! I like how we use big Doctor Frankenstein switches for everything. That's one thing the engineers got right around here. So, now I need to start the train...which is, not up here. I'm going to go out the window because there's no glass and nobody can yell at me. That's just one of the perks of killing everyone. Speaking of which, if this doesn't start, I think I'm going to take it out on that guard. Ah-ha-ha! All aboard! Just kidding, I'm not going to give rides to anyone. Wait, wait. I did it wrong. That switch controls the track, not the power. Let me climb back... Come on! Stupid sloped edges! Fine! I'll walk. Eh, screw it, I'll run. The thing about running is that I'm not really building up any muscle mass, so it's not like--WAH! Okay, yeah, the benefits and drawbacks of running don't compare to tripping and doing a faceplant on a white hot burning gas pipe. That's just about the worst possible thing I could do, actually. But, yeah, I'm in awesome shape. And I've been running in circles today for miles already. There's just no point. I'm sure I worked off those Doritos hours ago. Hey, you know what? I don't want to hear it. Okay, now I'm going to pull this switch and make my dreams come true. Or, at least my really unambitious dreams that I need to happen, like, right now. Okay, another exciting day in the life of a forklift operator. Well, technically this isn't a forklift, but, I imagine operating an electric tram is a good stepping stone towards building a solid forklift operator career. You have to aim high. Huh, if I took over the world, I'd want my henchmen running around all the time throwing switches. So, this is good because now I can-- Okay, careful. Because now I can say I did the same thing. Although, that implies I wouldn't make people do something I haven't done myself, which is totally not true. I'd sacrifice people by the cartload if it meant I could get better parking or not have to wait in line. People pass it off like it's a bad thing, but I think the Mayans knew what they were doing there. Yeah, I see you staring. You'll keep your mouth shut if you know what's good for you. You look like you've been gut-shot. So, you're lucky I don't reach in and take out your small intestine and tie it off to use as rope so I don't have to keep running up here. I'm not going to do that because it's gross, plus I think it'd be too slippery to get a grip, so be grateful. Okay, are we going to go? Yeah! If I can get out of here fast enough, maybe I'll still have time to hit the clubs tonight. I just need to shower. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this? You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Boy, optimists are retards. This is a joke! I'm finally heading the way I'm supposed to, and somebody's gone and stacked up a wall of concrete dividers for me. This is non-negotiable! I HAVE TO GO THIS WAY! I've gone down every other passage here. There hasn't even been a locked door. Just a straight-up dead end. Christ, they double-stacked it. I guess I could... ...climb over this. But that kind of defeats the purpose of killing everybody. That's why I did it, so I could have a smooth ride out of here. I deserve business-class! Screw this, I'm just going to ram it. It won't accomplish anything, but it should derail the train and that'll look cool. This reminds me of back in high school when we had a driver's ed class and the gym teacher was asking us which was more dangerous: Crashing a motorcycle at 60 miles-per-hour into a haystack, or crashing a motorcycle at 60 miles-per-hour into a concrete divider. He got mad and started yelling at the class when no one answered. Okay, time to end my tram-operating career. If I was a conductor, this is how I would want to retire. Just jump off and let it speed away with everyone on board. Hey, what the hell?! That should've stopped a dump truck! I don't understand anything today. Maybe they were made out of Styrofoam and just painted to look like concrete. Somebody was just trying to psyche me out so I wouldn't go this way. Well, it didn't work! I made it through anyway! I'm too clever for that. Actually, I guess I'm not, because I really did think it was concrete. But, nobody was around to see me get confused, so I'm still a genius. Hey, who are you? What are you doing here? Give me some money. What? No, listen, that's not my job! No! Shut up! Look, you have the wrong person, all right? A lot of the scientists here are senile. They probably said my name or were thinking about somebody else. What are you doing? Well, whatever. Thanks for stopping the tram car, I guess. I'm not sure how you did that. Hm. Oh, and there's no exit behind me, so you're going to die down here if you don't leave. Later! Ah! String things. Okay, you're dead. God dammit! I did it again! And we're going down! This is screwed! Oh, nice! It's flooded! Does this even work? Oh. Hope it lasts. Can't have the bloodmobile stop now. God, I am just covered in blood again. It's too bad I can't duck my head inside my suit like a turtle. Then I could just ride by covered in blood with no head and people would have to make up stories about me. Whoa! What's that electrical arc there? Okay, I'm going to go slowly. Ah-ah! There it is again. I'd better pick up the pace. Electric mystery bolts of death are...not...my thing. Thank goodness I'm wearing a metal suit. What's that noise? What? All right, I'm not an expert in the field, but that sounds to me like the cries of the damned. I'm not where I should be. I'm going to come across a bunch of dudes in robes chanting, making some sort of sacrifice with daggers. Then I'm going to have to fight their summoned demons or whatever. Hey, maybe that's the--PLAH! Maybe that's what I've been dealing with today. What I've been calling aliens are really demons. Not that they can't be both. Like how every square is a rectangle but not vice versa. Hey, are those boards blocking the track? Oh! That's a good sign. Is this thing going to collapse if I move forward? Knowing our engineering, this is made out of balsa wood. Okay.... Oh, that's good. Playing Jenga with my life. Crack.... Well, the tunnel hasn't collapsed yet. I don't understand how that got built in the first place. Why would anyone build a wooden platform right across the tracks like that? Maybe some bum has been living down here and the trains don't get used much, so he was building his house there. He was probably planning to jack the track's current for his own house, use the water below as a sewer, and maybe tap into some of the pipes. That's pretty hardcore. I don't think I'd have the guts to build my house in the middle of a train track. AH! Who's doing this? I hope the bum doesn't stalk me because I played the big, bad wolf and ran a train through his house. Oh! What's this? Aliens who can't shoot back! I'm going to take my time here. Come on. Stand still. What? I think that's all of them. So, are these demons or just aliens? If they're demons, I could fool them. I could duck my head inside my suit to pull off the headless rider act. I'm already covered in blood. They would see me pass and wouldn't think anything of it. Hey, is this the right--AAH! Christ! God! Jesus! Oh, I know that sound! Christ, the fun just doesn't end around here, does it? Bomb shelter parties are the best parties because bomb shelter parties don't stop. Until everyone's dead. There it is. This really isn't worth my time. Stupid sentry gun. They need to learn I'm their master. I'm not going to be around to kill them forever. Okay, what's the deal with this hook thing blocking the track? This looks heavy. I don't want to move it. I'm sick of all this manual labor! I am practically royalty! I shouldn't have to stand for this. Maybe I could take it on foot. This train's only saved me about five minutes of walking anyway. I'll just go along the ledge-- no, I don't think I want to go this way. I'll come back once I'm convinced this is the right way. I'm not convinced of that at all. What's this thing? Maybe I broke it. That could be--here. There, it clicked. I must've fixed it. I have to fix everything in this damned building. This isn't my job. See, this is what we need slaves for. I think we really screwed up the handling of that as a nation. We were only enslaving black people. That's stupid. That's redneck reasoning. We should've just freed the existing slaves, wiped the slate clean, and grabbed new slaves from a larger pool. Like, if you play the lottery. You can win a million dollars, or you can become a slave for life if you pick the wrong number. That's a better risk vs. reward balance. I mean, what the hell kind of risk is a $1 ticket? Do the same thing for voting, getting a driver's license-- have a new system where every society member has a small risk to become a slave, except me. Especially you! Hold on. Stop. Stop. Back it up. This might go somewhere. Yeah, I'm kidding, of course. I have serious doubts that you bastards can even be domesticated. My soccer ball game was a much better idea. Okay, anyone else have a surprise for me? No. Ah. Okay, yeah, that either sounds like a really exotic bird, or else damned souls crying out to be released from their never-ending agony. I can't think of any other options. What's over here? Stuff. Gah! Wow, I guess it should've occurred to me that there's a reason this room is full of dead bodies. I walked into that one. Hey, ammo. Hm. I don't have a bandolier. Maybe I should make a necklace out of the extra clips. I bet I'm one of the few people who has need of a bandolier. Gotcha, bug. Oh, wow! It opened. Something must be wrong. Yeah, I don't think this is the right way. And you look busy, I'll leave you to your work. Don't follow me! Don't follow me. I don't take strays. Yeah, see, it sounds like you have everything under control. I mean, if they don't kill you, then I have to shoot you myself, and that's just more work for me. Case in point! You know what the ridiculous thing about all of this-- The ridiculous thing is--hey, a switch. ...is not only did he choose this line of work, but he's probably getting paid pretty well for this, with hazard pay. Meanwhile, I'm caught in the middle of this and I'm not getting paid anything. I'm basically doing volunteer work right now. These are community service hours. God DAMN that is nasty. Ugh. See, I don't want to be here, but somebody has to kill everything. I am not getting used to this. Oh my....eugh.... I've gotta get out of here. This is like a repeat of when I worked in fast food that summer. Oh! God! Well, I guess this part's a little different. I mean, we would joke about mystery meat, but look at this. Okay, elevator, good... Sparks, bad... Damn, damn, DAMMIT! QUIT BEING METAL! If I was a wizard, this wouldn't be happening. I'm wasting my damned time. I'm trying to open this elevator, but I'm 90% sure this elevator only goes down, like everything else here. That's pretty far down, though. All this security must be protect something. I bet we have gnomes down there mining precious metals and gems. I want a gnome. Damn, there's another alien. I'd put my gnome in a cage and feed him granola. I think they'd eat that. Eh, who am I kidding? If the aliens got down there, they'd have eaten them all by now anyway. Gnomes are small. Wait, are gnomes even real? I can't re--WHOA! Dammit, I'm being followed again. What happened to that soldier guy? I thought he was taking care of this? Nobody's doing their job. Why is everyone who's not me such a problem? Y'know, some people might argue I'm only focusing on the negative, but I think that's because I can't think of one thing today anyone else has done right. All anyone has been doing today has been breaking things, running around screaming, shooting the wrong people, or dying. I mean, what am I supposed to say to people? "Wow, you sure did a good job falling down that elevator shaft!" Or "Way to lock yourself inside the freezer. I'm so proud of you." Hey, this is the homeless guy's foundation. I'm going in circles again! I'd better speed up. If going to go in circles, I want to go faster. Wait, wait wait, wait, wait. I haven't checked this tunnel out, and I'm still waiting for hidden treasure. We get funding for a lot of shady projects. Maybe there's some Nazi gold back here. Siegen sie mir das geld. Eh, there's nothing here. Just a dead end and some more boxes. Probably filled with network cards we can't use. BNC or something. Well, back on the labyrinth ride. See, I'm remaining calm about going in circles because I know I haven't investigated every possible path yet. See, there's one. I don't know where that goes. Some people stay lost their WHOLE LIVES! Eeeh... In fact, most people. EVERYONE! Everyone's lost, except me. Except for right now. There's that hook again. I'm going to come back here if I can't find the right way. I won't be surprised if this entire track is devoted to taking people in circles, but I will be disappointed. Hey, there's one of those signs again that might do something. I'm going to shoot it. That's so weird; it spins the wrong way. Now, did that actually do anything, or am I shooting at things for no reason again? Ah! It did! I'm surprised that worked. I wouldn't have thought that shooting road signs was the correct thing to do. I always thought that-- Jesus Christ, are we running a geothermal plant down here, too? Stop, stop. Okay, a dead body and an alien who hasn't seen me yet. I can put one and one together. Actually, that's one and negative one. Now it's negative two and me. But wait, wouldn't I be number one? I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. See, this is why you have to define your terms. If you don't, people die. Oop, there's that tentacle again. Bad spot, chunky. Get it all up, I'll wait. I should've just driven the tram straight through it, but, I dunno, that might've caused it to come crashing down on top of me. Wouldn't want that. I wonder if circus people already know about these things. Carnies. Some of the strangest things I've ever seen in my life have been at the freak show. Ah, but they had the freaks in cages where they belong! Back. There might be something here. Besides death, I mean. I doubt there will be. I'm sure I'll go up the stairs and find nothing but a stack of dead bodies, with a smiley-faced sticker attached-- with a smiley-faced sticker attached-- Fugh! That was sneaky! Where did you go?! Well, let that be a lesson to you. How did those bastards know to jump towards the only vulnerable part of my body? If I was quick enough, I might be able to headbutt them, but I don't-- Now, what's this? The sentry gun? It can't be bothered to shoot those aliens crawling around, yet it has no problems seeing me through a wall? These things cause more problems than they solve. Ah-hah! Buttons! What did that do? Oh, it moved the hook. So, why the hell was that there in the first place? Well, that opens up some options. And I'm going to be Mr. Efficiency and switch the track while I'm up here. Because maybe I'm just a pessimist, but I get the sneaking sensation this track is going to find a way to send me back in circles again. I mean, why should it be any different than anything else in this building? I don't think this tram has any real function here. It's just some CEO's fantasy track. Why have a model train that goes in circles when you can afford the real thing? Aah! Yeah, I'm sure before long, I'll start seeing some giant Styrofoam trees. I will say that I do dig this sign-shooting track switch system. I mean, I thought there'd be a control station with--Ah, wire! I AM going in circles. But no, they just want you to shoot the signs. Like drunk hillbillies shooting deer-crossing signs from their pickups. Works for me. Hm. Gunfire. I've changed my stance from that being a happy thing. HEY, DON'T MIND ME, GUYS! I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH! OKAY! YOU CAN CUT THAT OUT! I'M REALLY NOT TRYING TO GET IN ANYBODY'S WAY! OH MY GOD! WHY IS EVERYONE SO HOSTILE?! THIS THING'S SPINNING! I'M GETTING DIZZY! I CAN'T SHOOT YOU ACCURATELY WHEN I'M DIZZY! WHERE ARE YOU?! NO! YOU FLANKING ME? I'M...READY...SORT OF! I think I'm just going to take a breather for a minute. I should've been a pirate. Arr, these caverns be no place for a gentleman of fortune such as meself. I sees no more agitators in the forward, I best be plottin' a new course for the topside. Me mechanical longboat been servin' me true. I hope the musket fire changed your inclination none. What be here? Arr, down's not the way I be seekin'. I already done spend enough time below deck to last me two lives over. Well, enough hemmin' and hawin', it be high time I aweighed anchor and shoved off. 'Tis true of the--what be that noise? Arr, these caves be haunted, says I. But, livin' and dead alike shall bow before the great Cap'n Freeman. Avast! Gunner off the starboard bow! Arr har har har! I deadlights captured thee afore ye could repel boarders. Didn't care for the taste of me repeatin' flintlock, did ye now? Well, blow me down for an old sea calf. 'tis a beauty of a cannon, that there is. I'll be mountin' that on me vessel once I's done explorin' this fort's armory. Arr, I could surely go for a bottle of rum right now. Ahoy there! You lunkheaded milksops! Don't you know who you're quarrelin' with?! I be the great pirate Freeman! Arr, that way be soundin' a mite dangerous-like. Perchance I be goin' this way. Sink me. Well, ain't you the sly one? Gettin' the drop on ol' Freeman. 'Tis of no matter; I'll lays all athwart. I sees there be no treaty to be made what with the likes of thee. If it's a fair fight you're lookin' for, then you've come to the wrong man. Yarr, the battle be ragin' outside, making now the perfect time to plunder. Devil burn me! These stores be filled with empty boxes! What manner of trickery be behind this? Arr, enough of these monkeyshines. It's time I be handin' out a lesson in humility to these swabs. I'll load up me miniature grapeshot for the task. One blast of this and they'll be wishin' they were in a different line of work. Come back, you cowardly cur! Arr, the bloodlettin' be flowin' over. I shows no quarter to lubbers such as thee. You call yourselves Marines, but mariners I says you're not. I bet none of ye could rig a bunt gasket 'round a master jigger if your lives were hangin' in the balance. Arr. But I do thank ye for all the munitions ye swabs been providin' me with. It be a shame for them to go to waste what with so many of thee left to cut down. Fire the cannon! Arr har har har har har! Them that dies be the lucky ones! And there be plenty lot goin' round today! A-har-har-har-har.... By thunder, what be this? I knows-- Arr, I knows not what be transgressin' here, but in my sight, you're all not better than a bunch of fightin' cocks. Now, what do we have here? An anti-scurvy machine. Shiver me timbers! By the powers! There be all manner of queer beasties in this hold. I cares not for 'em. Now, what booty be so special here if it weren't guarded, I asks. I aims to find out. Arr, this must be the brig. You stinkin' bilge rat! I swears, the men behind this mess will all swing for sure. Ho there, squire! What say ye to joinin' me crew? I gives you me affidavi', I'll give you a cut of any loot we take. Yarr-- Yarr! That be the spirit! Let us charge forth and paint the walls red with blood! go any further. Quakin' in your booties, now are ye? Ye yellow-bellied sapsucker! Just follow me! Arr, get down! Get down, I says! You blunderin' squid! What good are ye now? A fine mate you turned out to be! Curse it all! Arr... That jack be right handy at his post. Unlike some I could name. Arr, I best be awaitin' this one out. I wasn't goin' to give that swab any of the loot anyhow. Arr, this scalawag be a right thorn in me side. Let it be known that-- Eh, okay, that's enough of that. I've got another 20 years and a lot of whiskey drinking before my voice sounds like that normally. No more piracy for me. So, do I still have problems? I still have problems. This sounds like a job for Ambassador Pineapple. You'll be representing me on the floor. Now, go out there and work your magic. Oh, sounds like we came to a resolution. Testing, one-two? Testing. Well, I'm glad everything worked out. So, what's this? "Surrender..." Oh, shit! They know my name! Fuuuuuck! This changes everything. I can't just waltz out of here now; I'm wanted! Dammit. My beard betrayed me! They got an ID because I'm the only fucking scientist here with a beard. If I'd gone with that stupid Einstein hair, they wouldn't be able to pick me out from a lineup. Okay, focus, focus. The first objective is to not die. That hasn't changed. The second is...to not... detonate this missile, I guess. Ah! God! Damn! Jesus! Fuck! Yeah, I guess nothing's really changed, has it? You dumb bastards. This is the WRONG PLACE to lay an ambush. You don't set explosive tripmines down then start firing automatic weapons next to a missile, all right? I understand you guys have hostility issues or whatever and want to kill me, but regardless, I would think that weapons are the one thing you jarheads might understand something about. That's not a good sound. I'm leaving. This is suspiciously convenient. I haven't been used to things going my way for quite a while now. Hey, hey, maybe it's karmic balance. Since now I know I have much bigger long-term problems, I'll have less short-term ones. No, lasers, aliens, I just flat-out have problems. But I'm willing to share my problems. See? Now we all have problems. I really do have problems, though. Oh, hey, a door. Stop, stop, I command you. Okay. There's got to be some money in one of these rooms. No, this is the wrong one. Ah, thought you were sneaky, huh? What the hell? Did it just shut the door on me? But I'm a great salesman! Hi! I'm selling these fine used bullets. Free samples. Oh, it looks like you already have some, from the looks of things. But then why is there no-- Ah, the missus of the house! Try some of our product. This sale isn't going very well. I'm just going to grab the ammo and leave. It smells like a vomitorium in here. Makes you wonder what the purpose of this room was. I'm not even seeing a storage crate. What's this? "Yore Dead". Wow. I can't even make fun of that. Military intelligence aside, how did they know I was going to be here? This is a dead end. Okay, that's it. No more side-paths. It's not like I know where I'm going anyway, but that security guy said I could take this track straight to the surface. Now, I do know he's a liar, but so far, he's said things that have been half-true. Y'know, like the Devil. So, statistically, it makes more sense to follow the advice of a half-liar, versus making completely random decisions like I have been. What is that? JESUS CHRIST! NEXT STOP: RIGHT HERE! YOU CAN HAVE THE TRAM! FUCK! You just wrecked my train of thought. Uh, I should turn my light off. So, uh, are we cool now? I don't think he sees me. That's good, but I--OH! I don't like how liberal this guy is about firing rockets inside an underground tunnel. He's playing Chicken Little and doesn't even know it. I don't think this guy's got an architectural, engineering, or even a geology degree to accurately assess the load-bearing stress of rock that's on this tunnel. Rocky the rocket ranger.... God! You see, I have to kill you before you kill yourself! And me! Well, either that's a hit or he's a very good actor. As long as he stays down, I don't think I need to do a confirmation kill. I'm not at that phase in my life yet. Okay, so how do I operate this thing? I want to blow things up, too. Oh, I think it's out of rockets. Oh well, guess I'm walking now. God-damned rocket launcher.... You know, everyone's always told me that I'm paranoid and I need to calm down. But guess what? I'm alive. And everyone who said that is dead. That's the ultimate proof that someone doesn't know what the hell they're talking about. "Follow my advice and you'll die just like me! Huh-heh!" I have the US Military spray painting my name on a wall, setting laser traps, and firing a fucking rocket launcher at me, and people have the gall to call me paranoid. Fuck them! Fuck everybody! Anyone who doesn't listen to me deserves the fate they get! I should kill everyone just on principle! See, this is what I'm talking about! "Aliens aren't invading, Freeman. You're just being paranoid." "The mailman's not spying on you, Freeman. You're just being paranoid." What else? "There's no society of anthropomorphic frog people living in the sewer, Freeman. "You're just being paranoid." "Owls can't read your thoughts, Freeman. You're just being paranoid." Bet you wouldn't call me paranoid now if you were still alive. How about expecting five monsters to ambush me, is that paranoid? Oh, hey, that's nice, the tram stopped automatically. Well, I'm not seeing any controls, but if this can ram a concrete divider, then I'm sure it can handle a simple wooden gate. I am unstoppable. Oh, what the hell? Something's tripping the brakes automatically. Piece of crap. Can I move this? No, it's locked in there. Well, I-- no, wait, wait, wait. I bet the controls are down that hallway and there are a truckload of soldiers waiting to shoot me. I've done this dance before. They can keep the damned tram. I'm really not that attached to it. I'm not like those Jabba the Hutt bastards I see in Walmart scooting around in their motorized carts. I can walk. And seeing how these clowns operate, I'm sure that concept alone is going to thwart their plans for a while. I just hope they don't figure out that laser tripmines are more effective when you can't see the beam. That could cause me some problems. Oh, look who called it. I think I've just saved myself and a lot of other people some trouble. Let's see. Oh, yeah, there he is. He doesn't even see me. Yeah, look at him. He is expecting me from that doorway. Glad I didn't go that way. So, wait, did I see another tram? I did. Where's this one go? Ah, another gate. So, the noise would alert this guy, and I'd have a grand journey of about 30 feet. I don't think so. Hm, I really am bummed that they've identified me, though. That means I'm a fugitive now. So, they've probably frozen my bank accounts. I need to get back to Massachusetts. I have about $10,000 in gold buried in Harold Parker State Forest that I put I there for exactly this kind of situation. Now, I didn't anticipate I was going to get framed like this. I put it there so in case I got caught embezzling, I would have some sort of exit strategy. Now, granted, $10,000 will only get me so far here. But if I can make it to India, I can live like a king with that kind of money. The American dollar goes a lot farther over there. Maim apane na'e bhagavana hum. Mere se pahale ghutane. I'm going to need a fake ID. I'll check in with Eddie once I get out of here. He can probably hook something up for me. I'm going to need a car, too, but that shouldn't be too difficult. I can just take some motorist hostage with my machine gun and drive to Massachusetts that way. Going to be a long drive. Hm, I hear soldiers. I'm not stopping here. And look, there's another gate with no switch. So, there really was no point to taking the--OH GOD! Good, stay! That sounds like a heavier caliber gun, and, while I admit I'm curious, I really don't feel like another bullet-resistance test for this suit. Ah-hah! Elevator! Yes! Oh, my God, it goes up and it doesn't even snap! This is amazing! What? Explosives. Oh. I should think about this for a minute. You know, I'm really starting to think maybe this whole thing isn't a rescue operation. So. Explosives. Yeah, I think I'm going the wrong way. I've obviously made a mistake somewhere. I mean, I haven't seen any dead bodies lately, or blood smears or bone piles, and that's usually a sign the trail's gone cold. Yeah, see, there's probably a ladder here. There's no ladder here. Just these one-centimeter rounded grooves to mock me. See, if I had a grappling hook, I could just go "whoosh" up there. Then "whoosh" up there. Really, you don't need a physics degree to grasp the concept. But the fact that I have one is just insult to injury! I guess you don't need an architectural degree to figure things out, either. I mean, what if this elevator went out? Or, what if it was planted with explosives? Can I move this? That's pretty heavy. So, the question is, are these plastic explosives, which are harmless without a detonator, or are these maybe nitroglycerin-based, where, if I start banging these crates around, it's the last thing I do on this Earth? Well, why take a chance? If I'm going to level this place, I'm not going to be half-assed about it. I'm going to do it right. I HAVE TO BLOW EVERYTHING UP! IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO PROVE I'M NOT CRAZY! Okay, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down! Oh...boy... I didn't think this through very well. I can't keep rationalizing away everything like this or I'm gonna die! Trinitrotoluene doesn't care what mood you're in. What--what's going on? Why isn't this rubble? I see stress marks in the walls, but that's it. Those weren't firecrackers! Hey, what's this? This is...this is a satchel charge! Oh, that would've been pretty handy about a minute ago! Then I could've detonated this remotely and not risk a cave-in! ...which...may still happen. I should go. Huh, well, looks like somebody saw a good show. Okay, going up, yes, up. UP! I'm starting to question whether I ever really did have a life that wasn't underground. Things get strange down here. Ah, electrical arcs. Being electrocuted is old hat for me now, alright? Well, it seems to have a pattern. Yee! Don't switch up. Don't switch up! Why is it arcing straight into concrete? So, is my education about electromagnetism wrong or is the WORLD wrong? Oh. Well. Damn. I guess I could jump these, but if I scuff it, then it's going to hurt more than a little bit. I'll play it safe and just crawl under. Besides, I really can't recall any safety advice that says to run and jump around explosives. That would be dope if they had something like this for hurdles at the Olympics, though. If a runner screwed up, he would just explode. I bet the adrenaline would increase performance. Huh, I guess the alien disaster isn't slowing down production any. Gotta keep those shareholders happy. Today's episode is brought to you by the number 8. Just what are we shipping anyway? These look like engine parts. OH GOD! NO! STOP! STOP THAT! STOP! What the fuck?! Did they just pop out of a box?! Why were they in a box?! That's Looney Tunes crap! Jesus! Well, they caught me off-guard, I'll give them that. I wonder if that was their idea or if it came from up the chain of command. Yeah, I could envision some cigar-smoking general ordering this. "Yah, put two soldiers in a box! "When the enemy approaches, they just jump out. "It's brilliant!" I bet they're both named Jack, too. Hey, what's this do? Oh. Great. That helps a lot. Maybe I should've taken the tram, I don't know. Then I could've loaded it up with dead bodies, and just sent it forward. That would probably creep out everybody down the line. That would creep me out. If I was working in the lab and this cartful of dead scientists just rolled in. It's a real conversation-stopper. Yeah, these goons write "Yore dead, Freeman" on the wall, so I send them back a cartful of bodies. Who wins then? Psychological warfare worked for Vlad the Impaler, it can work for me, too. Okay, looks like more crates and lasers that way, let's see what's over this way. Yeah, I'm not going this way. All right, so this must be the right way. That was easy to figure out. So, I guess that-- Stupid flashlight. Huh, I guess I'm pretty lucky the power's still working down here. Because, if it went out and the flashlight stopped working, I guess I'd have to navigate my way by the light of my muzzle flashes, which would be less-than-ideal for a lot of reasons. "Sector E Material Transfer B" Yeah, I'm lost. This doesn't mean anything. Oh, what the hell, a dead end? But, it's Sector E! It goes down again? How is that even possible? Well, I don't want to turn around. That's even more depressing. Yep. Going down. God dammit, I want some pills. All right... I guess I could just pretend I'm some giant submarine, but that wouldn't make me feel any better. Whoa! Lots of lasers. Watch your step. So, I guess let's check out the-- WHOA-HO-HO-HO-HO, what is that? Hell's coat rack, I don't think so! Yeah! AAAH! DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE! Okay. I think I got them. They flanked me. Which is why I know there's one under HERE! Oh. Maybe not. I don't think they can fit in the drawer. Even the extra long one. "Well, here we are in New Mexico, back on the Laser Corral, "roundin' up aliens so we can, well, I dunno what we're gonna do with them." Okay, I don't want to try and do a roll through here. There's no room for error if I'm off. "Space varmints!" Oh, hey, grenades. Glad I didn't hit them with my shotgun. Okay, I'm going to pretend there's a world where not all glass is bulletproof. Hey! Look at that! That's the power of imagination. Hah! I bypassed it. No one can cage me. Kind of sad, though. Here we have this giant underground complex and all these lasers, and instead of having a rave, we're using it for evil. Oop, speak of the devil. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he saw me. Or did he? Yeah, I think he saw me. I wonder if they're like infants and think, when they can't see me, that I've literally disappeared. No, I guess they're more developed than that. God, one of them's in a bunker; this is going to take all day. I'm not touching you! I'm not touching you! I guess that game doesn't really work from ten yards away. Man, killing the soldiers is one of those chores where, if I had any option at all, I'd just put it off. Hope it solves--Oh shit! Back, back, back! Actually, now would be a GREAT time for the lights to go out. I could make ghost noises and he might stop firing. You can't kill a ghost! Okay, this isn't working. I'm going to have to get closer. Out of the frying pan, into another frying pan. God, I'm really slogging through here, going inch by inch, laying down a lot of gunfire... So that probably means that this is really just a dead end, and I've been taking the wrong path this whole time since that fork in the track. I'm going to kill all these people only to find out they were guarding some janitor's closet. Dammit, I can't see anything. Oh. That's right. Stay down. Well, I probably creeped him out by getting so close to him. This is sort of like playing "Marco Polo", except we don't say anything, we just shoot at each other. And it's more intense. Marco! Oh, wait, he's the blind one. So that means I'm "Polo". Shit. Polo! Polo! What? Oh, cool! I won! Time for the victory dance! Dahdah, dah dah...wait, wait. There could still be some more players. And what the hell is that crackling sound? Yah! So, you're the behind all this! Not anymore. Okay, let's see if I can go another ten yards without running into any soldiers. Nope. Hey, I'm outside! No! NO! Oh...ri- There! That's for trying to guilt trip me! Yeah, the Big Bad Freeman! OF COURSE! YOU GUYS DIDN'T START SHIT! I don't know why I'm a patsy, but I'm not going to take it. Fuck the system! Ahh, I'm outside. All right! Okay, blast door, blast door. This way. Man, I can't believe it's night already. Wait, are these all closed down? Fine, I'll climb out, I don't care. Here we go. Christ! The sandstone just breaks off. I'll find another way. I need a rope. Maybe I can strip down the soldiers' uniforms and splice one together out of it. But that's going to take a while. Nice night out, though. Is that a full moon? Awoooooooooooooooooo! That security guy said this track would take me straight to the surface. Okay. Now what was the LONG way to the surface? Ahem... Awoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Wait, what the hell am I doing? That's right, I was going to get out of here. The moon's a secondary objective. God, I still can't believe it's night out. It only felt like a couple hours. Dammit, everything's like this now. People always say, "Time flies when you're having fun," well, what happens is that time just flies, period, and we all end up older. All right. Let me see, maybe I could pry this door open, I dunno. What's this? "Extreme Heat - Clear Area". Yeah, right, this is probably just where the department has barbecues and they put up that sign to make it private. I know how people think around here. Hey, a keypad. I don't know the code. I'll try some random numbers. No. Okay, 1-3-3-7. No. 1-2-3-4. Ah-ha-ha! You know, as much as I'd like to claim this is the result of me being a genius, it's more that someone else was not. We probably spent tens of millions on this security system then paid our janitor minimum wage to install it. Knowing this code makes me a threat to national security now. SPEAKING OF THREATS...! Whoa! He just-- Did I see that right? That guy in the beret just shot a grenade round at his buddies there. I don't think he was even aiming for me; I was just the excuse. I mean, what is this? "The Three Stooges Join the Corps"? There are three of them. This is crazy. Not that I'm complaining about the friendly-fire, but, wow! I always expected this sort of thing to happen to the Stooges actually. That one day Moe would just fucking lose it and kill the other two Stooges for incompetence. Well, maybe not Larry, he could be brought back into the fold. But definitely Curly. Curly Joe was beyond redemption. Any more Stooges?! Shemp, is that you?! No, just three. Oh, good, bloody handprint. Now I know I'm going the right way again. Whoa... that's a lot of explosives there. And tripwires... This is like that joke where you balance a bucket of water on a door, but, as usual, the military here has to overdo everything. Well, whatever's in that door is obviously not worth keeping. Oh, so maybe that wasn't a guiding bloody handprint but a warning bloody handprint. I don't know, I just can't tell the difference. Hey, there's an open window. Why would they-- Well, that's not what I wanted to hear. I don't know, I think there might be something good in here. The path of blood hasn't let me down so far. These guys sound pretty chill considering there were gunshots and an explosion outside not two minutes earlier. I guess it doesn't occur to them to investigate that. And now we return to Ethical Dilemma Theater. Do I shoot them... or not? I mean, those other guys were making it pretty clear they did not like me, which is a capital offense, I guess. But these guys are just saying, "Alpha Bravo Position Flanker Gamma Delta--" Yeah, see, this is what I'm talking about. Okay, you can stop. Guys, I can't even hear myself think. Wait, what am I doing? SHIT! Daaah! Oh, God, those shots were close to my head! Why can't they aim for my impenetrable body armor like everybody else? One of those shots ricocheted off my collar! YOU GUYS COULD HAVE KILLED ME, YOU KNOW THAT?! Well, I guess this guy knows it. That's it, no more Mr. Nice Guy. I keep clinging onto the hope that ONE of these goons will hear me out, but it just isn't happening. This self-defense crap isn't cutting it, because I never get to fire first. Damn, no, not this way. Normally, I'd need a really good reason to murder someone, but this whole day's been fucked. Better than a hundred probably-guilty people die than one of them get a clean shot on me. I mean, look at all these dead scientists. This rescue mission's a disaster anyway. 500 dead, 1200 dead, who's counting? All right, where am I? Oh, I know what this is. Those are electron microscope shots of cells. Yeah, that one's pollen, I think. This must be the Microbiology Department. Why does the military want to kill microbiologists? I've never really known them to be a controversial bunch. I think some people yelled at Pasteur because they didn't understand what vaccines were, but that's all that comes to mind. But why do microbiologists need this very expensive hologram projector? We didn't get one of those. We could've used it more than they could. What's that say? Something about satellites? They don't need this. They're padding their costs to get more grant money. Well, damn, maybe they did do something to get shot. Pissed off the wrong general with these costs. And that's the attitude I need to start taking. Just kill everyone. If you're wearing a military uniform, you're dead. If somebody's grandma is cold and puts on a camo blanket, she's dead. I need to just be a psychopath. Hey, what's this do? Uh oh. Uh... Maybe I should stop pressing every button I see. JESUS CHRIST, I LAUNCHED A MISSILE! I'm not helping anything! AUGH! MY EYES! GAZE UPON THE FIERY DOOM OF THIS EARTH...! So, guess I just started World War III. This been a busy day. But, in the end, there's only one thing that matters: I did not leave any fingerprints. I was wearing my suit. I'm getting out of here. Yeah... I don't always know when I'm in over my head, but I'm pretty sure this is one of those times. Oh, and what's this? Could this be a ridged pipe that leads straight up the rock face? I think it is. Ah. That's right, I'm in New Mexico, aren't I? The middle of the desert. The middle of the desert. Now that I think about it, the flight in here might have been longer than I remember. So, if I were to pack it on foot, how far could I go? If I had food and water--which I don't-- I could go twenty, maybe thirty miles in a day assuming the sun didn't beat me down. Which it would. I really should have thought about this sooner. Okay, so maybe walking out is not the way to go here. Dammit. All right, I'm going to have find a car. God, the fun just doesn't end today, does it? Well, that's not a problem. I can cope. I'm going to kill everyone. It's not even going to be about stress-relief, that's a side-benefit. This is survival. People say you have to play the cards you've been dealt in life. I don't think so. I think if you've been dealt a stacked deck, you can knock the table over, pull out a gun and start firing on... life... I guess... I don't know. Huh. This must be some pretty jaded crickets to keep on chirping after that missile launch. Wait a minute, this wasn't open. And somebody moved the bodies. Okay, I've seen enough. With any luck, whoever was here went back into the endless tram tunnel and will be there a few days. Oh, no, no, no. Is this the only path left? Not down. I don't do down anymore. I've renounced my status as King of the Underworld. Well, I'm not going down there, so that's the end of it. Hm. I think a tram-based pizza delivery system can make a lot of sense. Hey, something just occurred to me. Why do microbiologists need a missile silo? That would be like our department having a... medical bay. Mm, my gun feels light; I should reload. I suppose it's possible I won't encounter anyone else hostile tonight, but... no, that's not possible. Yeah, it even has the red glow of Hell lighting there. There must be a way out of here that doesn't go straight through Hell. Well, if there's one thing I've learned today, it's that missile launches are not like the movies at all. I thought there were all these procedures, two different people with special keys, a small crew of people to monitor all the systems, but no. It's just a big red button that says "Launch". DAAAH! WHERE THE FUCK DID THAT COME FROM?! YEEE! I GOT IT THE FIRST TIME! I didn't see anyone. I may have seen a muzzle flash... I don't know... Blehblblbluh... Okay... Blehblehbleh...? Maybe I've been too hasty to judge about that underground passage. It's starting to look better now. Okay, go go go go go! Mehnuhn? Mehnununbid...? Then we're all in agreement, let's take the ladder. Yeah, better to reign in Hell than... get shot on the surface. Christ, those rounds left a pockmark on this suit. I'm going to have welt marks for sure. Ah, another tram. I'm going to be depressed if all this does is loop back to the old track. The hell is this? It looks like some sort of camera...? Can I sell this? It looks like good quality, whatever it is. Does this come out? No. Oh, wait, there's some sort of trigger on the back. Oh. Oh! I saw these. Okay, I think I'm done messing with this one. I don't want to touch it anymore. I'll take this one. I just hope it doesn't turn on while I'm carrying it. What the hell... it's like I'm caught fishing line... there we go. All right, um... on. Hm, I just thought of a paradox. Maybe the more people I kill, the less likely I am to be the fall guy. Because, sure, they could say I killed five or ten people, but can they really pin dozens and dozens of armed military personnel on me? I think--WHAT? NO! NO NO NO! NOT AGAIN! I'M OUT! Ah ah! Uniform! Unif-- New Yorkers talk like they're all big and bad, I bet they don't deal with half of this shit in the subway. I think if I ever hear someone complain about their commute again, I'm just going to punch them in the face. "My drive home's worse than yours." Well, that's two more to add to the count. Yeah, I think it's going to hard sell pinning all these killings on just me. What's this? This is useless. This doesn't go anywhere. What? Anyway, my background doesn't fit the profile: no military training, never fired a gun, acquitted for petty theft, not a member of any extremist organizations, has PhD in a theoretical physics. Yeah, that sounds like our man. What the hell is this room? I guess this is an abandoned missile silo, since we got enough funding to just keep making more of them. Of course, no ladder, no stairs. Guess I'll just drop down. So, who are some other spree killers? There's Timothy McVeigh. He had military training. Well, Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't a spree killer, but he received about as much government attention as I'm getting right now. He had military training... and was an extremist. Ugh, that's gross. Hey! Get a room, you two! This is a FAMILY missile silo. I have nothing more to say to you. Who else? Charles Whitman, military training. I'm a hard sell. I think-- Christ, you people were under the stairway. This place is low class. Let's see. Alvin York killed dozens of people and he was a hero. He didn't even want to; he was like me. Am I a hero? Eh, I don't know. I don't think it's heroic if the only person you're saving is yourself. I'll take that. Dammit, this whole place is flooded. Well, I'm running out of options here. All roads lead to water. It would help if I had a clue where I was going. I can't see a damned thing. Eh, screw it, maybe I'll find somebody's car keys. WHAT GIVES?! SOMETHING WAS BITING ME DOWN THERE! This pool sucks, I'm getting out! At least, I think I am. I'm having that sinister feeling again where every hallway here looks it loops back in on itself for no damned reason. Steady... Shit! Yeah, the water is always wetter on the other side. What the-- What the hell is that? It looks like a prison guard tower. I don't get it. This place makes no sense. ...it's unconstitutional... Okay, that passage is the only one left, I think. I'll check out. If it I looks good, I'll keep going. If it doesn't, I'll come back... or die, I guess. No. Oh dear God... Oh God... Oh jeez... Oh... oh... Okay, I think I'll take a breather. Oh man. That sucked. And those worms or whatever keep BITING ME! BLAGH! Air is good. We have a working relationship. Okay. I'm pretty sure nobody followed me in here, so I've got that going for me. I have supply concerns about the air in this room, though. Business needs to expand. We need more investors, which I guess would be plants? NOT WORMS! Worms are not conducive to good business. Look at this. They're trying to take over the market. I need to withdraw. I'm taking my assets with me and I'm going to look for business opportunities elsewhere. This is a tight market. No matter. Here at Freeman Industries, we practice sound investment strategies. Okay, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic. I'm sure there's minutes' worth of air in this pocket. PANIC! Oh. Jee-yaah, ooh... Wow, I wouldn't have thought this was the right way. I'm wet. Blehblugh! I wonder if there are places that do amphibious pizza delivery. Like by the beach or something. Damn, I'm kind of hungry, huh? It's all this swimming. And beating things to death with a crowbar. I should've brought some more snacks with me. Well, I'm not the only one who's hungry! Jesus Christ! Do we keep sharks down here? Sharks! What the f... Ah, hold on. I need to tidy this place up a bit. Yuck... Come to think of it, how much do I really know about Black Mesa? We have toxic waste, loads of weapons, missiles, and now a shark tank. Am I working for a James Bond villain company? I mean, I don't really care, but... Oh ho! I don't even know who's in charge here... I bet it's some bald guy with a scar on his face stroking a cat. Just watching security cameras all day. We're probably trying to take over the world and I don't even know it. What's that say? JESUS CHRIST! I would've shot you! It's a shark. What? Thanks, but I have a real gun. Tranquilizer... look, I appreciate wanting to preserve the specimen in the name of science, but if that thing gets out of line, I'm blowing its frigging head off. Oh, and hey, if anybody else comes by here, I need you to be a character witness for me. Don't fuck me on this. Now, what's this say? I can't read this at all... These look like my old notes when I would show up to class drunk back in grad school. That was pretty sweet. I could get piss drunk most nights Then hook up an IV to my arm with a saline solution and not wake up hung over. I would just have a buzz instead. It was awesome having a med student as a roommate. Hey, wait, what am I thinking? That guy said there's animal tranquilizer. I can get high off of that. I mean, it's pretty crazy stuff, but these are crazy times! Yeah, I don't think that shark could jump this high. Or, can he? I don't know, better safe than sorry. Where is he? Ah! Yeah! I killed the shark! Okay, here we go. Okay... Alright, let's take a look. Dammit, that thing's still alive. Ah, I don't care. What's this dart say? 10ccs... What the hell? This is Xylazine! I can't get high off of this! God dammit! RARGH! Go, go, GO, GO! Aah! Oh my God! FUCK YOU, FISH! Oh, it is on! You wanna eat me? I'll give you something to eat. You think I work at Sea World? Giving you free food all day? You're gonna have to pay for this meal. Come on up, I won't hurt you. Come on up. Sucker. YEAH! CALL ME ISHMAEL, BITCH! Stupid shark... That takes some of the fight out of you? Oh! Almost forgot about you! Oop, need to reload. Looks like I cleaned everything up. I am a bad ass pool boy. This water still looks nasty, though. But I'm not going back. Okay, more pull ups. Man, I'm going to be ripped after today. Now I need to hit the clubs more than ever. Hell, maybe I still can. If I get out of state, the feds aren't going to be looking for me in night clubs. I'll drive to Dallas. There's bound to be something popping there. Oh, what the hell is this? Strangle Juncture. Well, I'm not getting to Dallas tonight, that's for damned sure. So, what are my options here? I could shoot down every one of these tentacle things individually, but then they would puke up so much, this ramp would turn into a Slip 'N Slide of blood, and I just washed that off of me. Again! What I want to do is lay that satchel charge in here and watch these things blow up. But, call me old-fashioned, but I'm still squeamish about setting off explosives underground. I'm sure the studies show--oh, look, ammo. Ow, shit! I'M BOXED IN! PISS OFF! YEAH, THAT FISH IN A BARREL TRICK DOESN'T WORK SO WELL WHEN THE FISH HAS A SHOTGUN, DOES IT?! Well, that was interesting. Looks like the aliens are taking a page from the military's book. The military put soldiers in a box to pop out of, the aliens wait out of the box for me to go into. And it worked! Tactical combat is strange, man. No wonder people have to train so much for this stuff. Ah, "Wet Floor". Thank God for that sign. That is the number one hazard around here: wet floors. Whoa, shit, these floors ARE wet. I bet a higher percentage of janitors survive this mess more than any other type of employee. If they were holding a mop, they already had a weapon in their hands, they know the entire building, and they have the keys to everything. What the hell was that? I saw something in the water. And these annoying fucking chittering noises don't inspire confidence that everything's fine. That and it smells like mildew down here so you know that-- Oh! Wait! No! Oh my God! That is SO unfair, attacking while I'm distracted! You're acting like you're trying to kill me! What is wrong with everyone? I am finding it disturbing how little I'm seeing aliens fight the soldiers or soldiers fight the aliens. Everyone is trying to kill me and unarmed civilians. How dysfunctional is that? It's like if they think if I die, all their problems will magically be solved. What are they thinking? When the Japanese invaded Pearl Harbor, was our first priority to send the troops in to start killing off all the remaining dockworkers? No! It wasn't! Whoa, that looks dangerous. And it's refreshingly non-subtle. Okay, people, let's hear options. MacIntyre, you first. "Well, I don't really want to get back in the water this quarter. "For starters I just killed a shark, okay? "And I saw something swimming down there. "So, how can that be good?" Knox, what do you think? "Ah, see, I thought of that, too, but the Big Gaping Hole Strategy is flawed "due to the ragged chunks of metal surrounding it. "No, gentlemen, I think there's only one course for our company. "Allow me to demonstrate." Yeah, I'd like to see a fish do this. I think this proves that, in addition to aliens, I am superior to fish as well. There's--dammit...! I'm starting to get pretty sick of all this swimming--aaaah! I don't think this suit's really designed for it. I'm all waterlogged. I can't have that. That's how Bruce Lee died; too much water in his brain. Of course, I don't think that happened to him from swimming, it was painkillers or something. But then, hey, look at me. I am the Bruce Lee of physics. Wickazhaw! Oh, look, there's somebody over there. No, hey, I wasn't looking at you! WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT?! What? I JUST KILLED YOU! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?! Okay, no more making COPIES of yourself after you're dead! You should've learned about that in school. Hey, what's this do? Uh-oh. Um, off... OFF! Wait, I was supposed to stop pressing strange buttons, wasn't I? I haven't learned anything. Oh, is that all it did? That's not so bad. What is this? Knowing us, I bet these machines serve no other purpose than to crack nuts. That button says "Generator" but, give me a break. Why would you have two sets of ENORMOUS pistons slamming into each other like that? It's obvious what's going on here. It's the same as the crate-smashing room. If we don't spend a billion dollars one year, then we don't get a billion dollars the next year. And if we don't get a billion dollars the next year, then we have to go and spend more money on lobbyists to get the laws changed so we get our billion dollars the year after that. And nobody wants that because then we might have to compete with other lobbyists. We could get into a bidding war. That's how democracy works. On the other hand, the nutcracker room here is a sure thing. I make fun of it, but in the long run, it's probably faster and cheaper just to build the giant nutcracker, write it off and be done with it. BAH! There we go. Man, if I had known about this place earlier, I would've been tempted to get a dead pig, dress it up in a lab uniform, then throw it into the crushers here. Freak everybody out. You wouldn't be able to identify a damned thing without a lab report. The pig would probably be drained of blood, though, so I'd have to pick up some donor packs from Eddie to do it right. JESUS CHRIST! THAT WAS HELLA CLOSE TO ME! ANOTHER FOOT, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN INSIDE ME! Maybe that's what the crushers are for. For when those things teleport inside your head and you become a walking xenomorph. They provide a nice easy way for you to kill yourself. Like "The Fly"! "Help meeeee..." No, not you, dammit! Your help isn't any help at all! You're just breaking things. I can do that! AND I COULD DO IT BETTER! Oops. Uh... That was to prove a point. Guess nobody needs that computer now. I wonder if I just screwed somebody using our network. Network errors are lame. They're always "404!" or "503!" Why can't there be "Error 482 - Somebody shot the server with a 12-guage. Please contact your administrator." Oh, uh. Quiero un poco de drogas. ¿Donde estan? Tengo dinero. What? I'M BEING TRACKED?! No... What? No, shut up, shut up. What the hell is this? I have tracking devices on me? No wonder everyone keeps popping out to kill me! Why could no one else be bothered to tell me this? You said everyone's monitoring me. That means everyone's in on this. I... I'm going to need a minute to think about this. Okay, YOU get to live. That's about all I've decided so far. So no worries. You're good. Okay, this is getting real. I'm being tracked. So, my options are to either keep the suit on or else strip down. I don't mind walking around naked, but I do mind bullets. If I keep the suit on, I'll still have people trying to kill me ...which, I'm kind of used to anyway... But if I take it off and I get shot, then, that's it. I'm fucked. You know what I'm saying, man? You should! You don't even have a weapon! And don't think I'm going to give you one. Well, I'm not stripping in front of you, in case you're wondering. There's too many damned people in this building. Woah-ho...drafty. Okay... Oh, my god, it's cold in here! IS THIS 10 FUCKING KELVIN?! Don't get locked... Don't get locked out in the open... ....okayokayokaywarmwarmwarm... ...okayokaywarmwarmpipes, warm pipes... ....warm pipes good. Warm pipes... Oh...ooh... Frosty. Well, I was wrong about one thing: Those aliens are NOT from a swamp planet. Anything that can-- Oh, my god. This whole neighborhood's going to hell. What, with the gangs... Yep... Can't even walk down the street of your own planet anymore! I remember the good old days, when I didn't have to bring a gun to work, my coworkers weren't space bugs, I had a salary, I wasn't wanted by the government, then YOU happened! Ow! Was I shot in the back of the-- No respect, man. No respect at all. God damned outworlders are ruining this country. There was a time when we'd put you all in cages. And, if it was up to me, it'd still be that way. Some of you keep zapping me with electricity. That means you're a power source. We should be taking advantage of that. This is all so wasted. Okay! 10-4! I'll be sure not to do that! Eh, my intuition tells me that wasn't the full message. Something about him killing himself to make a point doesn't add up. That, and the silenced gunshot makes me think there's something devious going on here. Ah-hah! Hm. I don't see anyone. Maybe the problem went away. Maybe I willed it out of existence. Maybe it was the magical sniper fairy that comes and gives silenced hollow-point rounds to people who don't eat their vegetables. That was one of the Grimm's Tales, right? Ah, ah, ah! Ninjas! These aren't fairies! They're ninjas! Okay, move, move, move! In order to beat a ninja, I have to think like a ninja! Flank, flank, flank! Double back! I trace electron orbits! You think I can't find you? Fucking ninjas, man. Oh ho! Ninja in the closet. Ninja in the closet! Oh, some ammo. Yeah, I think I'll take that. Ninjas, man. I was not ready for ninjas. Who IS ready for ninjas? No one! They're ninjas! I've never even seen a ninja until today. Except for that dude at the knife store. They're probably already gone. Disappeared into smoke. Oh, nope. Well, this settles it. Black Mesa is a James Bond villain company. We have missiles, robots, lasers, sharks, and ninjas. Ah! "Surface Access"! Dammit... Eh, maybe I'll level this place. Whoah! Holy shit! It's morning. How did I not notice this? Man, I am tripping balls! Time is moving WAY too fast. Something's wrong with my brain. It's like that experiment where they kept that guy underground in a cave for a few weeks with no time reference, and his body adjusted to a 25-hour cycle. Oh, here we go. Except, in my case, my body's waiting to go-- Jesus Christ... Hey, it opened! What was I thinking about? Oh, yeah, I need a watch. Eh, that's okay. Watches are cheap. So, what should I do about this suit? What, with the ninjas tracking me and all. I'm starting to like how it's painted bright orange. I think it makes people want to shoot me in the torso instead of the head. So, should I take it off or leave it on? I don't know. The stripper's dilemma. If I wasn't a fugitive, I could publish a paper on this and get some money. I'll wait and keep it on until I find a car, then ditch it. No! Cut it out! Urgh... No... Ah hah hah hah hah hah hah... Okay people, listen up. Today, we're talking about fermions. Fermions have a half-integer spin NOT a full-integer spin; those are bosons. Where am I? Uh, hold on. I think we're going to have to move to another room. Somebody's renovating this place, I guess. I'm so confused. My head hurts. Man, I'm sore all over. Feel like I got my ass kicked. Jesus Christ. What was I doing in there? How did I even get in here? I want a drink. It doesn't have to be bourbon; I'm not too picky. You know, anything at least 80-proof. It smells like dog vomit in here. Oh, a hatch. There's the answer. Ohh, I don't know if I can reach it. I'll find a stick or something. What the hell did I do last night? I remember there was some guy with an eye patch. And a midget. Oh, perfect. What were they talking about? And some sort of scam involving corndogs. Shit, I don't remember. Ergh, can't reach. I can tell already this is going to be a fun day. Rah! Come on! This sucks. Seriously, how did I get here? I can't go through my whole life living like this. Oh, drain. If I party this hard every night, I'm going to end up dead in a few years. I don't remember what happened. I think I was watching a movie about monsters... ...and they attacked Canada? I mean, obviously, SOMETHING happened. I woke up in a trash compactor again. Yeah, this looks easier. Hey, the ruptured rusty rods reveal a rift! Whoa, wait, which way is up? Oh. Okay, that's cool. See? An exit. I'm one of the kids who paid attention to the hamsters in class. Wow, this is not my finest hour, is it? Spending the night in the Dumpster, getting dumped out of a sewer pipe facedown into a run-off puddle, waking up in the afternoon, I'm probably missing work, I'm lost in the desert, I have many unexplained bruises and facial lacerations... They say you know when you hit rock bottom, but I can't say any of this is completely unfamiliar. Except for being in the desert. That's kind of new. The last time something like this happened was Austria. Actually, Austria was even worse because I woke up naked. I had to wander around lost in Innsbruck until I could make some clothes out of old garbage bags. Okay, well, this part's different. Is this the only road? Eh... God, that's a big cockroach. Jesus! That's the size of a friggin' softball. On second thought, I don't think that is a cockroach. Looks like something out of South America. I should start watching National Geographic again. Oh, there's another one. I don't like the desert. Shit... Someday, I'll be president and it'll put this all in perspective. Oh! Shit! Somebody had a worse night than me. I'm not touching anything; I'm not going to be part of the crime scene. That is rule number one to staying out of prison. And to making proper measurements on quantum particles. Man, I want to get back to the lab. No, wait, something happened to it, didn't it? Huh. A giant bung. I'm not seeing an entrance. Good God, I'm in the middle of nowhere. How did I get here? Am I a werewolf? Eh, butts. I'll go this way. Christ, it's hot out here. I caught a break being passed out in the shade. Otherwise, my face would be sunburned. It's always real classy going to parties with half of your face burned red. This isn't the right way. I should come down. Uh... Oh, that'll work. Okay... Not bad. I could've gotten some sick air if I had a pogo stick. And a jet pack. And... all right, I need to get out of here. Wandering lost in the desert is not good for my career. Hey, what's this do? Oh, wow, it spins by itself. That...that's lazy. Power steering for when you're too tired to turn a valve. What's our obesity rate at? Isn't it like 30%? This is why I'm not in administration. I would've taken the money for powered valves and used it to put a door on the side of the building. Oh, hey, there's something down here. Lights and... oh, there's the door! Okay. I was confused. I have silly ideas about building design. Like, I wouldn't make people climb-- Oh, hell. Maybe that's how that guy died. I should be careful... Yeah, maybe he was just stepping outside the building for a smoke break, climbed the ladder up the silo, slipped at the top, then splat! I could be a detective. Although, as I say that, I still haven't figured out what happened last night. I remember having problems. Lots of problems. I'm pretty sure about that. Ah, it's an elevator. Like something we might've built in the Middle Ages. If we had motors... and water. All right, well, I think this was meant to be operated by a second person, but if I double-time it, I should be able to get up there. I wonder why it was designed this way. It was probably because of a union contract that says that we have to hire so many elevator workers and this is to accommodate that. Da, dada, dada! Climb, climb, climb! Monkey madness! Gotta get up to get down! Whoo... Hurgh... Huh... well... I'm pretty sure that this isn't the executive elevator. That would have carpeting. Oh. This is kind of a crappy entrance, huh? Oh well. I didn't see any rose petals waiting for me on the outside. Still, with our budget, this kind of bullshit. I think there's some class warfare going on at this company. Whoa. What's going on in here? I've gotta check this out. I seem to remember a lot of gunfire from yesterday. That's odd. Oh, he dropped his clip. I'll take it. Maybe I can sell it back to him. I wonder how much I can get from him. Probably at least 20 bucks. Ugh! What's going on here? FUCK! Okay, something's not right here. This requires further investigation. I'm not going to get my 20 bucks from him, am I? Okay, I'm not too sure what's going on here, but that guy dropped his gun. And guns open up a wide world of opportunities. It has blood on it, but it's a glock... Blehk! As for you. Yeah... Sweet! I want more things to shoot! Besides this pile of rancid meat. Oh, that'll work. Okay, I don't think I've fired a gun before but shooting things feels very familiar. And I didn't even have that dream where I was Snoop Dogg again. Yeah, I don't know, I think I shot somebody last night. Maybe a bunch of people. Well, I'm sure they had it coming. But, if that's true, I may have screwed up WAY more than usual this time. I should watch my back. And what the hell are these things? Besides dead? Hm, I'm low on theories. I think maybe these are some carnivorous plant cross-breeds that the Biology Department was working on where the containment obviously failed. Kind of like Little Shop of Horrors. Except we're the Big Shop of Horrors! Okay, I am still lost. Well, I think that's making sense. Biology had an accident, the specimen spread, but how do I play into this? I was probably down there trying to hit on Heather again and maybe she just lost it and knocked me unconscious Then tried to dump my body because, let's face it, she's pretty stone cold. Shit, they're back. Well, it didn't work, Heather! Now I have a gun! You can't stop the Freeman! Well, okay, I guess doors can stop the Freeman, but Damn. This kind of takes all the wind out of my image. Actually, I don't know if this was the Biology Department... Because, whatever those things are, they're animals. And we don't do a lot of engineering with animals. There's just not enough money in it. Wait, I'm going backwards. I don't know. I mean, there was that pollen we developed for Monsanto that would kill people. Everybody was really proud of that. I'm going to go out this way. Squeeze in here... Whoa-whoa! Augh.... Goat cheese massacre! That hurts my knees! This suit needs shock absorbers. And drugs. Why am I wearing this suit anyway? Did I steal it? I don't think I would've been THAT stupid. If Black Mesa reported it stolen, somehow I think the police would know to look for the last person who was wearing it. I couldn't have been trying to steal it. Why, this must be--! Yeah, I'm lost. So, if I'm wearing this suit, that must mean we had an experiment. Hey, we did do the experiment! I remember. ...sort of... There was lots of green. Okay, so we had the experiment. Then what happened? Oh, I know! Then I had to kill a bunch of COCKROACHES! Because I HATE THEM! ...want them all to DIE! STOP! Then, after that... I got depressed... And...okay, this is easy to figure out. Because, if the experiment was a success, I would've partied all night And got drunk off my ass and probably woke up in a Dumpster. But! I woke up sober and that sucks. So, that must mean the experiment was NOT a success. I probably got into some fights, then. Oh, man! This is where I just was! Ah well, it beats the desert. Plus, I have a gun! So, my prosperity is assured. Now, I just have to find someone and tell them I'm lost. If they laugh at me I point my gun at them. If they tell me they're too busy to talk I point my gun at them. It's really that simple. Okay, I don't think I've tried this giant pot-stirring room. I'm not sure what they're stirring, but I'm guessing anything luminescent and neon-green isn't very tasty. Okay, now if I hang down properly, this should work. Ah, much better. Now, I just need to learn to do that faster so I'll be ready when I come to work with the smoke bombs. Wait, which way is north? You're not north. But.... no.... Everyone here's a liar. I don't like liars. Christ, where am I?! This is just some chemical processing facility. I don't remember what I was planning to do today, but I'm sure this isn't it. Black Mesa is NOT a tourist trap. Of course! I've already been here. It's not just me! NO ONE should be here. No one comes to a half-abandoned warehouse unless they work there they're trying to film a low-budget horror movie, or they're a photographer taking bullshit black-and-white photos pretending to be artsy. That's it. And I'm going the wrong way again! I supposed I shouldn't expect the red carpet treatment breaking and entering into to the site of a chemical plant, but I still find the building layout confusing and I'll lodge a complaint with the administration if I find the front desk. Well, not this way. Oh, and I would also like to file a complaint about the number of locked doors here and about the mutant animals that appear to be eating people. Trespasser or not, I have rights and I'm entitled to a reasonable expectation of safety and comfort when I break into a place. This is America, after all! I need to get an attorney. This whole situation is completely unreasonable for someone of my stature. And there is-- Jesus Christ, this is the wrong way, too! Alright, I'm going to have to start thinking outside the box here. I should think less like a human being that uses doors and more like a squirrel that has anger problems. Besides, I think it's entirely possible I'm the first person to ever set foot here. My name will be in history books. Therefore, as these are new territories discovered by the Nation of Freeman any and all claims shall henceforth be named after me. Me! The official name of this monument will be...the... Freeman Industrial-Strength Mixer With Green Crap Inside of It. Hey, I think that's an entrance over there. That seems entirely worth the risk. Especially since I really don't know the contents of this. I mean, there's the possibility that this really is just a giant vat of gelatin and dye even though it doesn't smell like it... I mean, this is normal, what I'm doing, right? People do things like this all the time when they get locked out of their office. And.... Oh, wow. That thing could take my head off. Errragh! See, this is how you get promoted. What I'm doing right now, this is progress. I'm...sure of it.... Eh, if this ends up being a fuel line and gas starts flooding in here I'm going to look really stupid. I remember in some job interviews I had during grad school, they would sometimes ask me where do I see myself in five years. I never knew how to answer that question. And now, that I'm lost inside a drainage pipe in a chemical processing plant, this is why. Oh, this looks promising. I was expecting spinning saw blades. Or a pool of acid. This is much better. But, why are there no doors here? Did I actually enter this room in the correct manner? Maybe the room itself is alive. Um... OH MY GOD! I'M GONNA D-- Okay! I'm awake! I was a little drowsy, now I'm awake. Oh! Yuck! What is-- That-- that is nasty! I do not have to accept this. Oh, you bastards. Fine... Got to avoid the blood shower... This isn't the sort of thing I should have to worry about. Jesus! Where's this coming from? Maybe we don't even ship in meat. We just slaughter the cows right here at the facility. And then just dump them in the water like we know what we're doing. Oh my god! This better not get in my hair. If I wanted to smell like McDonald's, I would've stayed in the trash compactor. No! Open up! FBI! I have a warrant! Hey! Hello! I shouldn't be surprised the doors are locked. No one likes to hang out in the meat dumping room. Not even on break. So, how am I getting out of here? I'm not swimming through the fan blades. That's an easy option to scratch off. And I somehow don't see myself shimmying up a sheet metal wall. I am definitely late for work. Oh well! Guess I'll go with the flow! Fuck, I just know some of these meat chunks are getting in my hair. I'm going to need some serious shampoo after this. I'm not a leper. I shouldn't have to stand for meat dandruff. The exit must be on the other side. I wonder how fast I'd have to run to skip on top of the water. It smells funny here. And, there is no exit. What the hell, people? What's this? Ah, more water. Oh. That would explain the smell. What the hell are we spraying? I don't like orange. Orange is a bad color for industrial chemicals. We could get away with this if we were making Cheetos. But I'm 80% sure Cheetos aren't made like this. Hm, looks like I need to keep on swimming. Can opener! Yeah, swimming upstream is for losers. Losers and salmon. Cool ceiling. Uncool undertoe! Aaaahhhh.... This is a pretty shitty water park. I'm not coming here again. Oh, god, there's that gas. I don't want to breathe this! Jesus! Gas and a rotating crusher! Maybe I shouldn't be going this way. Well, hey! This room looks like something! It has steps and everything. That means I'm done with the meat processing ride! I think my values have dropped considerably since I woke up. Instead of getting to work on time, now I just want not die. And... oh, my god. This is that same room. I've gone in a giant circle again. This is horrible! Well, I suppose this good preparation for later in life if I get Alzheimer's. I'll wake up not remembering everything but still be able to escape the retirement home. Wait, what am I saying? I'm not going to get Alzheimer's. People who stay mentally active have resistance against that. And I mentally dominate everyone! When I get old, I'm going to buy that walking cane I saw that secretly transforms into a sword and scare the hell out anyone who doesn't show me respect. Glad to see air is part of today's itinerary. Hm, I wonder if I'll need a separate shampoo for my beard than I will for my hair. Oh, another gun. Whah! Okay, what the fuck did I just shoot? I'm totally justified, whatever it is. Looks like a cross between a leopard and... Cthulhu. Yep. That's definitely not a cockroach. Wait, I've seen these things before. Oh, shit! I remember now! These are aliens! Of course. I remember everything. I was in the test chamber. I was going to load the new sample in. Then, somebody cut the lights. And then some of the scientists put on these creepy-looking robes and started lighting torches. Then one of them got on the intercom and starting chanting this crazy ritual. Next thing I know, we have beings from another dimension teleporting in here like we're giving away free t-shirts. Oh no! Not this room again! I don't understand! Why do we make rooms that can't be accessed connect to other rooms that can't be accessed? I bet this guy died trying to get out. Hey, what's this? Oh! Satchel charges! These are how you create your own exits! Glad they were just lying on this desk. Wow, these things have a remote control and everything. Maybe I should hold onto these. I bet I could sell them for a good price. I'm sure Eddie would take these off my hands for me. He loves this stuff. This could turn out to be a good day after all. I think the revolver must be a Magnum. That thing felt like I was God! Pew! Thou shalt not eat my face! I am the Lord thy God! Behold me push these switches! Hey, these aren't doing anything. There. Now they're all in the "Off" position. Piece of crap. Why make a switch box that's clearly labeled, easily accessible, if it doesn't actually work? Now, an optimist would say, "Hey, that's two out of three." I say, "That's bullshit!" Ugh! I wasn't asking for a second opinion! Least of all yours! This is NOT a democracy! I have a gun so I'm in charge! Many governments around the world function on this principle! And some of them last for months! This is not complicated! You're making it that way! BLAH! Well, I guess the good news is: I'm not late for work like I thought. No work today. We have too many problems. Like, death. That was a pretty big problem for a lot of the faculty if I recall. I mean, it wasn't for me, but, c'mon. Although maybe I shouldn't be so cocky about my situation since I don't know how to get out of here and I don't feel like swimming again. Although saying that implies I felt like doing it to begin with. Button! What did that do? Ah! Don't mash my potatoes. Stop...no...not qui... yeah, there we go. I get it. Turn off the hammers then the switches. It's like sawing through a body at the joint so you don't have to cut through the bone. Wait, it's nothing like that. I'm confused. Okay, I think if I just break everything life will get simpler. Switch one, switch two, switch three, you suck. And that appears to have done nothing. Okay, this is why I study THEORETICAL physics. I don't normally have to do all the dirty work. It is so much easier yelling at a lab assistant to do things for you. Rrr, Jesus Christ. Body low... Whoa-ho! Nice speed! I guess today's more interesting than usual. I mean I'm bodysurfing on a conveyor belt at some creepy factory. Most people don't do that. Even on weekends. I hope this leads to one of those big plastic ball pits they have at themed pizza restaurants. That would almost make up for all the switches. Ah, no. We're getting off here. This part looks good. I mean, there's a ladder here. Surely, someone was meant to come this way. No. No one's ever been here. You know what? I'm going to go back to sleep. It's not like I have to work today. Nom-nom-nom... Holy shit! Was that a bat? No? Guess not. I-I can't sleep. I know I saw a bat. It's just waiting until I'm asleep to bite my face off. Where is it? Look at that ceiling, it could be anywhere. This is a losing battle; I'm getting out of here. The feng shui of this room sucks anyway. Why does this room even exist? It doesn't. I'm leaving it, therefore it ceases to exist. Well, not really, but that's how my memory needs to file it. Why are there enormous pistons here? If there was something on the belt, it would just crush it to the side and not send it anywhere. So, why would... Yes, master. Wait, no! Stop! I really don't understand what the purpose of this is. Other than to scare me. But, there are cheaper and more energy-efficient ways of doing that. I would feel better about this experience if I knew that on the other side of these walls, a giant robot was moving its fingers. It would seem more noble then. Oh wow. Seriously? We actually have crushers of death, too? What are we making in this factory? Something flat. Jesus Christ... Oh-kyaaah! Oh, they have different stomping patterns! Yeah, that's really necessary! Yaaah! Oh, this one's full of tricks! It's tapping out Morse on the fucking belt! Red lights, walking backwards, GIVE ME SOME MORE PRESSURE! I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH! YES! BIOHAZARD! PERFECT! THANK YOU! YAAAH! FALLING TO MY DEATH! TANK OF ACID! SUPERB! Sidestepping... I hear fire... but I don't see fire. It must be space fire. But I am not a space man, thus, I do not need to be extinguished. Man, look at these landings. Sideways freefalling on moving conveyor belts. I am a cat! It's kind of pissing me off this whole place is abandoned. I don't have anyone to show off to. If the workers were here, they could say, "Hey, look at him! He's ridin' a conveyor belt! I've always wanted to do that!" Whoa, oh my God. I can feel the heat from here. I need to get off here. Maybe this way... No, this way sucks. Okay, yeah, this'll work. Okay, that's the end of the ride. I can dodge giant crushers; I can't dodge an incinerator. I would need much better reflexes. And a more nebulous body. Until you can rearrange atomic particles the way you want them, I don't think anyone can ever claim to have true power. Oh, what's this? Another dead end? Okay... Hey, then why have safety railing and a walkway if no one can get up here anyway? I cheated! I came in on the conveyor belt! No one's supposed to do that! I could expect this crap on Mars. They have a 1/3 gravity; I could just hop up here. Not on Earth! Well, that drop wasn't too bad. Maybe I'm developing a resistance. It's like that joke on the Addams Family where Gomez tells an insurance agent he's learning to skydive with a smaller and smaller parachute until he doesn't need one at all. That was a cool show. I identified with Thing. What is this thing? It looks like a shrine. Maybe it breaks so much, they decided to install a light here for the workers rather than replace it. If your logic acts under the assumption that this thing will be breaking forever, then some decisions start making more sense. Something tells me you're not going to contribute anything to this conversation. I'm a good debater. Though, you do make a strong argument for not going that way. All right. I'm agnostic about which concrete corridor I take, having no other information than it's another concrete corridor. Oh, it's a dead end... with no storage here or anything. I see. We're playing that game again. Well, I do have...criticisms... about how this place is structured. Maybe I'm not one to talk, because I shouldn't even be here. But, you shouldn't either. So, there's that. Oh, hey, a door. This means that the builders of this temple were civilized. No... No, my mistake. They're savages. But, who am I to question their ways? Maybe they play hide-and-go-seek here when it's a slow shift. Maybe...they're doing it right now! And you...are...it. I win. Okay, so who's more at fault here? Me, for entering this place like I'm trying to break into the Pentagon? Or, everyone else, for not giving me an exit to begin with? And another dead end. No! Two dead ends. Classy. Okay, so that answers that question. It is NOT my fault, but will I be able to prove it? I mean, I looked. There was no entrance or exit from that other factory wing. But, of course, some jackass is going to come along later and show me an obvious one in a place I already looked. It wasn't there earlier. Like there's going to be one here tomorrow, I bet. Fucking gremlins are building it right now, just so I look like an idiot later. When the truth is, I arrived at this reality a little too early. Oh. "Stairs". That'll work. Shit. I feel like strangling something. It would be fun to be known as a strangler. I mean, it wouldn't be worth it to strangle people just to get the name, but if the police came up with a name for me like "The Sneaky Strangler", that would be cool. Okay, good. This sign points straight, not left four times in a row. That would piss me off. Oh, what am I talking about? I have a Ph.D. They'd call me "Dr. Stranglelove". Actually, that could be a porn name, but only for the edgier stuff. Ah. OH GOD! I'M OUT OF AMMO! WHOSE JOB WAS IT TO RELOAD?! THEY'RE FIRED! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'THERE'S NO AMMO LEFT'?! YOU'RE FIRED, TOO! I can't delegate anything around here! Well, at least I have my backup gun. Let's just hope I don't need a backup backup gun. Most people don't need that. Most people don't even need a backup gun. I guess it depends on what state you live in. Where the hell is this thing? I didn't imagine it. Draw! Well, it was a fair fight. No one can say it wasn't. Yeah, I guess this is presumptuous but I have to say that-- Oh, hey, there are stairs. That sign wasn't lying. What was I thinking about? Stairs... Alien... I wanted a banana milkshake... Oh, that's right. I'm a little disappointed by these aliens. They're not displaying much intelligence. They're naked. They're mostly just bipeds. I could come up with much better aliens than these. Okay...uh, hah hah! Joke's over. Where's the exit? Oh, my God. Alright, I already went through this red shrine thing, so I know where this belt goes. I guess I'll just try again. Maybe I missed something. Because, y'know, exits are supposed to be difficult to locate. Because, God help you if somebody exited your building by accident. Then, they'd have to come back in. Oh, hey, that's it. I didn't try this belt backwards. (gasping) Because it's the other... one I came in on... Okay...so let's talk better aliens... It depends on the gravity... and atmosphere obviously... but, if it's like ours... what you need is all the organs in the core... with many muscular appendages... with handlike grippers on the ends... If the inner ear...was developed... this would allow for extremely good mobility... and a natural advantage over us... for tool use... Huh... So, it would look like a jointed octopus rotated on an axis or two...with hands. No! Dammit, no! This is unacceptable! I remember lasers are bad! Tripmine! That's a tripmine! Why would we do that? Either everything conforms to standards or we blow up the assembly line. Is that it? What the hell? This is an American company. We're not supposed to have that all-or- nothing mentality like the Japanese. I'm going to shoot it. I don't care if it blows up the conveyor. It's their fault. Dammit! This is hard. I could use the scope, but it would just kick up in my face. Ah! Yup, I blew up the conveyor. Now the district manager has to commit hara-kiri or something, I guess. This reminds me of those old video games from Japan that were impossible to beat and if you died, they would tell you how many fingers to cut off to preserve your honor. Man, that barely damaged it. I guess it was a practice explosive. Are you fucking kiddi-- TWO?! (gasping) Just in case the... first one... wasn't enough? Jesus Christ... I can't crabwalk out of here... Okay, okay, I'll just grab the side... and squeeze through... Oh my God... it sucks big wads... (straining) (gasping) Fuck... I don't think I'm going to get a nap in today. There's just too much to do. Ah, door! Door! I-I can make time for that. If you ask me whether I'd rather open a door or try to kill myself... Actually, scratch that. Those are shitty options. I just want to leave. Oh, this is THAT door. So, leaving was never an option. And crawling in circles until you fucking die, THERE'S AN OPTION! I LIKE THAT OPTION! LET'S GO WITH THAT OPTION! BLAAAAAARRRRRGH! Actually, I was just kidding. I don't like that option. RRRRRAAAARRRRGH! Wait! I have satchel charges! I can bring this whole building down. Just need to find the right place. I need to get higher up, then I can find some sort of support beam to really collapse this place. I forgot I was even holding these things. Yeah, now I'm feeling a lot better about how I'm getting out of here. It's no longer an "if" situation. Honestly, this amount of ordnance is a real comfort factor. It's like having a square explosive teddy bear. I need a marker so I can put a little smiley face on it. Give it a name. Now, the most obvious ones are "Boomer" or "Boo-boo". But if I named it something like "Chuck", that has some nice subtleties to it. Hm, I'm not seeing any obvious spots here. It would be better if I could place the charges closer to where I could see daylight at least. Actually, I could get passed this conveyor. I'll try that first, then I'll blow up the building. Hah. Guard rails. Yeah, safety first! ...'kay... This isn't so bad... Whoa, whoa, whoa! "Radioactive"?! Are we saying crushing, drowning, burning, exploding isn't thorough enough for this place? Eh, screw it. I have a Geiger counter in my suit because I am trendy. I'm a fashion pioneer. So, I'll decide for myself if this place is radioactive or not. For all I know, they could be talking about the sun. It can be seen from a window. "Warning!" DROP-OFF! Ugh! Are you kidding? This is even worse than I expected! This is something out of cartoon! Oh my God! Those jaws killed space bug like an Earth bug! Oh, wow! My lucky day! This is a dream come true! I was a kid and I went to see Santa Claus, I told him I wanted to be in a cage fight with these tiny fucking monsters jumping at my face. And I wanted the floor to be made of a giant crusher that could kill me in one quick motion AND THE SIDES TO BE SLANTED, SO IF I SLIPPED, I'D IMMEDIATELY DIE! AND NOW I HAVE IT ALL! WHAT MORE COULD I POSSIBLY ASK FOR?! Christ, I hate having to make decisions under pressure like this. Of course, there's only one option, so... Oh-ho... Jell-O knees... I feel sore... I think I'll take a dip in this thoughtfully provided bath of... green glowing liquid that's... Oh, wait, this is a trap. I'm not falling for that. This isn't even a spa. What the fuck? It's like they're not even trying. Oh, yeah, "Radiation". Woo-oo-oo... Well, my Geiger counter still hasn't gone off, so, you're a liar, Mr. Sign. You'll fit right in this place. What is it with this intense red lighting and cramped corridors? I feel like I'm on a sub. This designer must've been Navy. Oh, damn. A grate over top. Is this necessary? If there's someone up there, I'm going to pop up and say I'm a troll and want some goat meat. Oh, God, they locked this, too? All right, well, I don't have much else to work on. Oh, that opened right up. Oh, that opened right up. Okay, I'm your dance instructor-- NO, YOU'RE STARTING TOO EARLY! STOP THAT! I SAID STOP THAT! 1-2-3 LEFT! 1-2-3 LEFT! NO, NO, YOUR RHYTHM'S ALL WRONG! Rrrgh! I give up; I can't teach this class. Some people just don't want to learn, y'know? Oh, hey, there's a box of ammo. Hell, these will fit the revolver. I guess being a teacher does have its perks. Oh, nice, it comes with a speed-loader. Though, I guess if you need a speed-loader, you shouldn't be using a revolver in the first place. But, here I am. In some sort of dog kennel...I guess. Except I'm on the wrong side of it. I'm getting out--no, maybe not. It's the amps that kill you, but do I really want the volts either? Well, the people who built this kennel didn't count on one thing: I'm not a dog! Actually, if the fence wasn't electrified, I think a dog could get out of here. But, I'm part of the Opposable Thumbs Club, so I think I'll play it safe. Oh, yeah, this'll hold me. Now, the trick here is to NOT do a belly-flop onto the fence. That would be worst possible outcome. Oof! Oh, boy. Nothing like the loving embrace of poured concrete. Y'know, I'm almost disappointed I DON'T see anyone following me because I'd like to see them go through everything I have. Or, maybe somebody was following me but they're dead now because they tried to keep up. That would be kind of flattering in a way. I'm just that good. What? WHOA! How did something THAT big sneak up on me? Yeah. Yeah, that got you to calm down. I can see you know what this is. Good. We're having some interspecies communication. Damn, you're as big as a linebacker. Looks like you have some sort of armor... An extra appendage... Yeah, you're definitely more impressive than the rest of the losers here. I could see you getting a job in management. Well, I'll let somebody else dissect you. I've already done more than my share in the name of science today. What is wrong with this world? All right, where are the keys? Do you have them? No, probably not. Button's locked... Computer's locked... Well, I'm the locksmith! Alarms? You'd think I would-- OH GOD! SEE, THIS IS WHY PEOPLE NEED TO DO THEIR OWN WORK! WHEN I HAVE TO DO THEIR JOBS FOR THEM, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS! Did I kill it? WAAAH! Okay, the bullet test is inconclusive, so... Let's see how it responds to a different set of stimuli. HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED! Christ. I hate biolabs. Hey, what's this? Why did a new set of alarms start? I don't like this. I'm leaving. Why is this door locked? I didn't even shut this. Shit. I think this what being an atom feels like. Oh. Uh. Well, I feel okay. But, something tells me I might sterile now. Oh, hey! I need some help! Don't be shy! BLAAAH! Wow. That is BEYOND rude. Oh, shit! I forgot. Everyone's trying to kill me. Yeah. OF COURSE! IT'S NOT MY IMAGINATION! EVERYONE IS TRYING TO KILL ME! AH HAH! FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU! FOOL ME TWICE, EVERYONE DIES! Yeah, I see right through you. Standing there, acting like you're my best friend when you obviously waved that assassin right on passed you. I can't trust anyone here. But, I never did anyway so I guess there's no problem! Yoo-hoo! Over here! You forgot your bullets! Take some of mine! You're welcome! Hm, I'm going to need some more ammo if I'm going to kill the whole world. Oh, here's some guns; that's a start. I'm a gun farmer. I plant bullet seeds in people at about a thousand feet per second and out pop more guns. Right now, I'm harvesting. So. I admit I really dropped the ball forgetting everyone was trying to kill me. That's so unlike me. Usually, that's the first conclusion I come to when things go wrong. If anything, it's less stressful now since I don't have to wonder if they're going to kill me. I know they are. Oh. Ammo. No more second-guessing people when they give me shifty looks around the coffee machine or pass me in the hall. I can just kill everyone. It's a catch-all equation. But, I still don't remember why everyone's trying to kill me. I just remember people showing up and shooting. That's not very progressive. Are you kidding me? This is the fucking lobby! Why are these doors locked? From the inside! Who said that?! Somebody's watching me. Fine! They don't want me to leave the building, I can improvise. Watch the glass... I have a good suit but if those shards got in my eye, oh man. Dammit. Come on! There's no grip. All right, I'm going to have to go find a crate or something. Th-this is doable. Y'know, I seem to remember having seen a crate before. Hm. Or a grappling hook! Wow, I could really use a grappling hook. I'm going to buy one from Play It Again Sports or someplace once I get out of here. Okay, new job: Find something to climb out of here. I'm doing a lot of jobs. Every employer I've had pulls this crap. They hire me to do one thing, but what they really mean is one thing plus fifty other things because they don't have enough people. And, guess what? I'm the new hire. So, I do it. Forever. Right... Well, at least Black Mesa has a legitimate excuse that most of their workforce is dead. Gotta cover for the dead guys. Now, what's this say? "Superbus Via..." I don't know much Latin. Language of science, my ass. It would be kind of cool if I wrote out "Latin is a dead language" in blood and made it look like one of the soldiers did it as his dying action. People would say, "Wow, those were his last words, huh?" Make them think. Hm. I guess I could stack these bodies to make a human staircase out of here. But, that's going to be a lot of hauling. I'd probably need at least five or six. They're heavy, too. I'd wear myself out if I moved all of them. I'm sure there's a cheap lab stool around here somewhere. What was that? I don't like hearing explosions if I'm not the one making-- God, Jesus...! Frickin' door conspiracy! You can't tell me there isn't one. They know... Hey, a button! I've got my button-pressing gloves on and I'll--wait... Wait... wait.... Maybe I shouldn't press THIS button. I'm getting some weird vibes here. Like, why is there a dead guy inside these cages? I don't know what department this is, but this isn't how we kept our lab. If someone turned up dead in one of our experiments, it got cleaned up immediately. I'm not going to press that button. I'm going to press THIS bu-- no, maybe I shouldn't. I'm having déjà vu. I've been in this room before. The last time I pressed that button, I remember a white hot light and then the universe felt just a little bit emptier. We shouldn't be making these buttons. Whoa-ho-ho-ho! It's that time of the year again. Okay... TAG! YOU'RE IT! NOT YOU, THE OTHER GUY! YOU'RE IT! YOU'RE IT! YOU'RE IT! RRRRR! No tag-backs. Oh, nice. I have the hiccups. Man, I get really nervous after killing people. Is that normal? I think it's because there could be other people to kill and I never really know if my job's done. CLEARLY IT ISN'T! THAT'S A PRETTY BIG OVERSIGHT IF I'M TRYING-- WHY IS IT MY JOB TO KILL EVERYONE?! I almost feel like my degree is being wasted here. I mean, what I'm doing now really has nothing to do with quantum mechanics or general relativity. There's just no crossover. Don't come near me! Don't come near me! No! NO! I HAVE A PERSONAL SPACE ZONE, GOD DAMMIT! PERSONAL SPACE! Nobody has any respect for my privacy! They all think I've done something! Out of ammo, okay! Sorry! Sorry about that! Thought you were somebody else. Did he buy that? I would--I don't...I don't know. Maybe he respects my privacy. I mean, there is no actual RIGHT to privacy, but it's implied by the rest of the Constitution... and this gun. What's going on here? It's a prototype cheese slicer, I guess. Doesn't look like it's going too well. Okay, where is this guy? I can't have somebody sneakier than I am running around here. Then the whole system falls apart. Oh, I think I got him. Yeah, that's right. Thought you could take cover in this completely empty hallway with nothing in it. And the door opens so that means you weren't trying to run away. So, that really was your plan. Well, you're not going to make sergeant like that. So, looks like I've gone in circles again. But now, I can do it on the next floor! I can't wait; I'm going to run up there. OKAY, I NEED EVERYBODY TO CALM DOWN! JUST CALM DOWN! I CAN'T HELP ANYONE IF YOU'RE NOT CALM! ARE WE CALM YET?! YES?! NO?! OH-OH MY GOD! WE NEED TO RELAX! YOU'RE NOT RELAXED! JESUS CHRIST! Aaaahhh.... This session's off to a rocky start, but I think I just need to change tactics. OKAY, LISTEN UP EVERYBODY! ARE WE CALM?! RELAX AND FOLLOW THE SOUND OF MY VOICE! I NEED YOU TO TAKE DEEP BREATHS! DEEP BREATHS! YES, THAT'S GOOD! NO! NOT LIKE THAT! START OVER! Actually, I think that's all the time we have for today. We'll meet again next week. Okay, now that everyone's calmed down, we can start thinking rationally. It stands to reason that with so many of you here, there must be a functional entrance. Unless I'm imagining everyone here. That would be a game changer. Hey... Whoa! That's awesome. I'm going to leave this on. It looks expensive. Hm, that is something to think about. If I am imagining all these soldiers, then I'm just shooting random people. Or maybe nobody at all. But, if that's the case, then it make sense why-- --people are trying to kill me. Dammit, not you! You're not even people! Wuaaah! Bouncing nightmares... IF I WANT YOU LITTLE SPACE MAGGOTS JUMPING AT MY FACE, I'LL ASK FOR IT! AND I'M NEVER GOING TO ASK FOR THAT! Well, lasers make me happy. Maybe not as much food, some painkillers, bed rest, not being persecuted, just getting my life back on track in general. But, hey, I'll take lasers. Some-some kind of weapon? I'm hearing voices again. What? You know, for every mistake I make, somebody else is making an even bigger one. Yuck. Well, I'm not touching that thing. I doubt it's any safer with blood all over it. Hey, how did those guys get in here? Oh, of course. Through the ceiling. I guess they blew up-- --the rope they used to get in there. I guess I'm getting jaded in that seeing some body parts lying around doesn't freak me out the way it used to. It still freaks out most people. A lot. Like, if we're able to cl-- oh, hey, a button! Damn, I don't think it has any power. But, yeah, if we were able to clone body parts easily, I'd just want to sprinkle them across the countryside and covertly videotape people discovering them. Small towns where not a lot happens would be best. Just leave-- Just leave a severed arm lying there on Main Street. Especially if they don't know it's cloned. Wait, I've already been here. Christ... So, then a week later, I'd come back and leave a cloned leg there that's just as fresh so that they think I'm hacking up some guy in my basement. People would worry over nothing. It'd be great. More lasers. Fuck yeah! Maybe if I turn all these on and redirect them, I could start shooting down the satellites. That would be so rad. Oooh! I can feel the hum off this thing! Let's try again! Oh-ho-ho! Bad ass! Bad ass! Oh yeah! Once I reorient this thing, I can shoot a satellite down for sure. Somebody's going to be missing their TV channels tonight. Oh, yeah! I'm going to start the Laser Channel. All lasers, all the time. Actually, I guess it's not all the time. That's a problem, isn't it? I need a way for this thing to fire continuously. And it's not doing much good pointed at this wall. I need to reflect it somewhere. What's that say? "Do Not Obstruct Laser Shield" Big letters, too. It looks almost asking for someone to obstruct it, isn't it? I don't care for your rules. Now I want to see what happens when it gets obstructed. There, that should do it. I've never used a laser this big. I don't know what'll happen. If it starts bouncing everywhere, I'll just run out of the room. (chuckling) Aw-aw-awesome! It's burning it up. OH! That's even better than I expected! Look at that sucker! Aw! Oh no! Don't stop; let's keep this laser party going! Get a disco ball and some music in here. Maybe clear out the bodies. Hell, shoot the laser at the disco ball and set this whole room on fire. Hm, this material is slower going. It might take me too long to carve a tunnel out of here this way. Even though that would be totally awesome! Hm. Wait, where does this room even go? It goes down. Can't say I like that. But this whole building's a dead end except for the ceiling. I guess I could push that crate all the way downstairs to get out. I mean, I don't have any duct tape, otherwise, I'd tape down that button, take a nap, and let the laser burn a hole out of here. But this crate must weigh at least 200 pounds. Damn, and I'll have to push it up those other stairs, or else go the long way around with that ramp. Screw that, I'll check out this room first. And, hey, if I (gasps) If I slip and crack my skull, then, at least I know this was the wrong... ...decision. God, no matter how much I try, I can never ignore gravity. It's just always there. Talk about oppression. It's-- (screams) You never get a break. Yee...! Unless you're... completely underwater. But then, you can't breathe. So, what the hell? This is an awfully big ceiling. Maybe they used to have a giant trampoline in here. I would. Oh, oh! Okay... Well, I-- JESUS CHRIST! TRYING TO FLANK ME! Okay, everybody, shut up! I need to think. Okay, I won't be killing you because you told me exactly what I wanted to hear. Hey, what did I just say?! I can still change my mind! There's enough in this clip for every one of you. Okay, let's do the Get Outside thing. You! Come with me! Oh! So, you think YOU'RE the brains of this operation, huh? God damned RIGHT you will! Okay, Dopey, YOU come with me. Okay, now this slicer is kind of dangerous. You ought to know; you designed it. Now, just take your time. It's only a concentric circle pattern. All you have to-- What the fuck? Looks like I picked the wrong man for the job! Jesus Christ! This just looks bad for everyone involved. God. Oh, yeah, better make sure the door opens. That would really cap things off it if doesn't. Good. If this was locked, it would be a massacre trying to get this crew to climb up the pipes I came down on. Okay, people, time for Plan B. I don't like how you're looking at me. Are we going to have a problem here? Good. Okay, I guess, you too. That's it! I've had enough lip from you! You stay! No, you're pissing me off is what you're doing! What I SHOULD do is to turn that cheese slicer back on and let you form your own escape plan, brainiac! Like I need your help. Well, if they're anything like Poindexter back there, I think we're on our own. Oh, now watch out here. These aliens ended up on display somehow. I hate these things and you should, too. And don't tap on the glass. They hate that. See, watch this. Shit! I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT! Wow, you're pretty chill about all this. Kind of unnaturally so. I guess you're autistic. Great. Well, follow me. God! Well, I don't know what to say. I don't know why all the glass in the hallway shattered at the same time. Or why you would design something like that. I also think the sirens are really unnecessary, though that would make a pretty good alarm clock sound. You'd wake up and think there's a bombing raid going on. Well, here's the scanner-- AGH! I SAID NO TAGBACKS! WHAT THE HELL?! Christ, I thought I got this guy. Oh, unlike here, right? No, I'm going to leave! Dude, you've been shot! You should find some gauze; make sure the bleeding's under control. No, don't walk on it! I've taken some shots, too, but I'm in plated body armor. Big difference. Big, big difference. Stop walking on it and go find some disinfectant! That's irony for you. He's the only person in this building who's been even remotely helpful. So, naturally, he's going to get himself killed. Oh, my God! I'm outside at last! Again! Agh! This endless desert isn't big enough for the both of us. Huh, it's kind of hot out here. But, I still don't want to go inside ever again. Whoa, it looks like somebody lost an argument. Oh, there's that noise. Is that real? I don't like that noise. Okay, I saw something. Not a weathervane! Not a weathervane! It looks like an anemometer, but it is not! Anemometers don't fire bullets, not even the expensive ones. Or, I don't think they do. If they do, meteorologists are more hardcore than I thought. Well, I don't know. Maybe. They chase tornadoes and crap. Maybe this is what happens when they get better funding. STOP BEEPING! No more measuring wind speed for you! So, maybe this is the Meteorology Department. That would explain all the skylights. Doesn't really explain the lasers or slicing machine, though. What's this? Or the crates of explosives. Actually, I don't think this belongs to the Science Team. We make our own. Okay, don't shoot this. But, yeah, I could see meteorologists taking things up a notch. Like they normally release weather balloons then just count on people to be nice and mail them back when they land. Instead, they could deploy motion-sensor turret guns on landing, send out a locator signal and shoot anyone that got too close. They'd get their data then. Now, is there's another turret gun waiting for me? Oh! Somebody did not hear me through their helmet. You know, the Art of War talks about terrains, spies, the use of fire, but, I'd bet if Sun Tzu had access to satchel charges, he would've authored a whole new section on them alone. Wow, they didn't notice that? They must be listening to the radio. I'm going to change the station. Well, all in all, it's not such a bad way to go. Confusion for half a second, then death. I would feel bad about this, but morality is for people who don't have other people trying to kill them every five minutes. I mean, this isn't like a basketball game where I'm winning over and over. "C'mon! Let us win just once!" "C'mon, Gordon, let us kill you just once!" Yeah... Jesus. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I hope you're not upset about-- Never mind. Whuh-hoo, well, that wakes me up. Wow, I almost feel like I don't even need more stimulants today. I guess I need some downers. Wow, I didn't know we had a dam. HAD a dam... I...don't...think my suit can stop mortar shells. Oh, a helicopter with rockets. So, that means climbing the rocks out of here isn't really an option. Well.... Shit! I'm embarrassed that I've been outwitted by a squad of soldiers with mortar shells and a helicopter with rocket missiles in a boxed-in canyon, but, here I am. Boy, I feel like an idiot. I'm showing up with a gun to an artillery fight. That's like showing up with a rocket launcher to a tactical warhead fight. Of course, I didn't KNOW this was going to be an artillery fight. Oh, boy. I don't even want to be here! They can blow up the damned... dam... for all I care. Dammit! I'm pretty sure this is unconstitutional. Even cops aren't allowed to mortar people. I mean, what happened? Was there an emergency session of Congress to vote on bombing me? Okay, think. I guess I'll just rush them. If I stagger my approach, they should miss. NO! I CHANGED MY MIND! I DON'T WANNA DIE! SHARK! SHARK! OH MY GOD! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I FEEL SUFFICIENTLY MOTIVATED TO LEAVE THIS PLACE! I DON'T NEED YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT! I SAID I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP! YOU HAVE NO FAITH IN PEOPLE! BOMBS BAD BOMBS BAD BAD BOMBS BAD! Okay! Suppressive fire in, suppressive fire out! Do the hokey-pokey and that's what it's all about! STOP SHOOTING ME! I'M NOT THE ENEMY! GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE CLOUDS! Boy... what's it take to get some peace and quiet around here? So... let's assess the situation. I'm in a damned canyon. I'm stuck on this damned tower. What's in this damned room anyway? It's a damned button. Sounds like that did some damned thing. So, how am I going to get out of here? The soldiers blew up the damned bridge, and that damned shark's still in the dammed water. Ah hah! Maybe he's faking it. No, I think I got him. Well, that's one less damned problem to worry about. But, how am I going to get up these damned walls? I don't see a damned ladder anywhere. There's no damned steps. This is a damned mess. Why did those damned soldiers blow that up, anyway? I bet they're trying to cut the damned power. That means, all those scientists are going to get stuck underground in the dark. Well, that's their damned problem. Okay, my options look pretty damned limited this way. Ehh... I'll guess I'll just check out what's around that bend. Maybe there's a cruise ship that'll serve me some drinks. Okay... Hey! There's nothing there at all! It's a damned dead end! The water must be seeping in underground. That doesn't help me at all! I'm sick of this damned place! I didn't kill that fish just so I could-- --just so I could take over its job! Hey... maybe... ...there's a tunnel. There's some sort of valve down there. Maybe I could flood the whole canyon. That'll at least make me feel better. Okay, we can do this. Air...air is for losers. Haaaa.... Waaaahh.. gaaahhh... Well... I'll be damned. I didn't really think I was going to do anything like that again. Okay, let's get down to business. Does this guy have any money on him? Or snacks? This guy doesn't have anything. Well, don't expect any fare for Charon from me. If you're too cheap to keep even fifty cents in your pocket before throwing yourself off a dam. Gotta save your money, right? This stream better go somewhere. If it doesn't, I'm going to have to start an avalanche. I have explosives. Okay, big giant wall with no steps. Not what I want to see. No... No...! Why lock that gate? Who do they think is going to break in? I'm trying to break OUT. They think someone's going to sneak in with a bucket and steal their water? Ah. I could fit into one of these pipes. But, which one? I'll try this one. If there's a midget squatting here with a knife then I'll just go in the other one. Hm. Oh, what the hell? They tricked me AGAIN! Why have two runoff pipes if the circumference is exactly the same as the source? Although, I like how they added lights here. That's awfully considerate --and wasteful-- of them. I bet maybe someone comes through here twice a year. If that. But, then again, we have a dam. May as well pimp the tunnels with extra electricity. Oh, no... There's another one?! Oh, this is going to be a long day. I'd say I need a surface-to-air missile, but no one should NEED a surface-to-air missile. That should be firmly under "Wants and Desires." This is bullshit. Another helicopter? I get the feeling something doesn't want me alive. Besides the obvious. Yeah, okay. This is the wrong way. I mean, sharks, mortar shells, attack helicopters, drowning... some force wants me dead. Maybe that's why all of this is happening. I was SUPPOSED to die yesterday in the test chamber but I didn't because I'm hardcore, so now reality is slowly unraveling. That makes me the most important person in the universe. Still don't like getting shot at, though. Okay, I can jump this. How did this guy get here? I guess he fell out of the chopper. Well, glad they're using up missiles on something besides me. So, if I die, will reality slowly correct itself or will the world just end? It might as well be the end of the world if I'm dead! God, how many helicopters are there? Too damned many, that's how much! Alright, yeah, more missiles. I never really had an opinion about it before, but after today, I think we definitely have too much military spending. That's what, 20%? It needs to be, like, 1%. Look at this guy. He's flying like he doesn't give a fuck how many missiles he uses. He's not paying for it! He'll probably use the extras to blow up cactuses--cacti! YES! FIRE MISSILES AT ME! THAT'S TOTALLY NOT OVERKILL! NO! Now, which way do I go? OH, MY GOD! IT IS SO HARD TO CONCENTRATE OUT HERE! Oh, nice, an arch. Yeah, let's see you shoot through solid rock, there, tough guy. Man, I'm a little light on ammo after shooting that last chopper down. I think I just got lucky on that last one. I mean, these are only, what, 9 millimeter? Their hull can probably take that. I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to have the idea of shooting at a helicopter. FUUUST! YAAAAH! OKAY! I NEED SOME VOLUNTEERS! WITH YOUR HELP, WE CAN SHOOT DOWN THIS HELICOPTER! GOD DAMMIT! YOU'RE NOT HELPING AT ALL! DO I LOOK LIKE A HELICOPTER?! NO! I do NOT look like a helicopter! If I did my life would be less complicated in some ways and more complicated in others. Actually, my life's gotten REALLY complicated lately. I guess I'm not doing as much...math. That part's simpler. But, I like math. Math has zero bullshit tolerance. "Storm drain hatch"? Where? Yeah, just as I thought. That did nothing. Storm dra-- it probably rains here once every three years. Haaahhhhh... If I smoked, this is exactly where I'd have a cigarette right now. Smoke tobacco. I guess I'd smoked peyote, but I'd rather chew it or take it intravenously. Oh, here's a good hiding spot. Oh, wow. More explosive rounds. Yeah, I could think of a lot uses for these. Yeah, this would actually be a terrible time to take peyote. I don't see how a good trip would be even possible. Oh, man, shells! This is a treasure stash! Maybe, if I'll keep looking, I'll find a big bag of cash. That would simplify my life. Maybe since the universe is conspiring to kill me and failing at it, that means I can break more rules and get away with them. Like, I could go in and rob a bank, and, even though there's only like a 30% success rate at that, I'd be the one to get away with it. YAAAH! AAAAH! WAAAH! LEAVE ME ALONE! I'M ON MY SMOKE BREAK! Uhh.... These things burrow?! I don't think so. "Mines"?! Okay... I guess don't go passed... this... point... Fucking "Tremors" man.... Oh, look, my best friend's back. Okay, time to visit Chataeu du Rock again. Don't cave in on me! Okay, I don't know what I'm looking at, but, there's a dead guy, so there's that. I guess I could talk to him, see if he knows anything. Hey, I was right. It's something horrible. Jesus Christ! Whoa! Whoa! What's the range on that thing? Wrong answer! I think I'm just pissing it off. I'll leave it alone. Maybe it'll grab the helicopter. Then everyone will be happy. And we'll have balloons and ice cream and cake and-- Hey, I've been here already! I'd know that mound of sand anywhere! The desert tricked me! And, God dammit, that helicopter won't give up. I feel like all that propeller spinning should be affecting the axial procession of the Earth, even though I know it doesn't. The Coriolis Effect is not working for me today. But, I will say that my career's turning out much more varied than I would've thought. Nope, no treasure here. Physicists don't usually see this kind of action. Too much action! Gyah! YAAH! YAAH! YAAH! YAAH! YAAH! Huh. This is kind of how claimed my lab space at my first day of work. Except I didn't have a shotgun for that. But, I didn't need one. Okay, this is the wrong way; I'll be leaving now. And, I guess going in circles the other way, maybe some options will open up even though they shouldn't, but-- Okay, you are way too big. I wonder how this fits into the ecosystem. It doesn't seem to be actually eating anything. You missed! All right, that gives him someone new to play with while I walk in circles again. "Mines"! Man, is he following me? YES! This is the place I should've decided to take a nap. Wait for him to leave. It's too loud, though; I'm never going to get any sleep here. So, where are these mines? I guess, passed this hill? You will get--BUZZ OFF! I thought I hated mosquitoes and then I met you. Okay, maybe he thinks I'm going that way now. You know, I think this is the first situation I've encountered in the past two days where a grappling hook would NOT solve all my problems. So, I guess I went in circles because I didn't want to walk into a fucking minefield! What great options. I need a can of orange spray paint so I can tag one of those bodies and throw it out as a decoy. Dammit! I swear, every time I come out from underground, you'd think the world's ending. Oh, wait, it IS ending. Because I'm alive! Whuh-haa-haa-haa! I don't think they'd put mines on the very sides, did they? Eh, the rock wall should be good. Hell, the signs are on THIS side, so that means they're expecting movement from the other side. Yeah, I'm good. Well, good in the Mine Department, not so good in the Helicopter-Pilot- With-A-Hard-On-For-Me Department. Neither of these departments were a problem before today. Hmm. Oh! Open manhole. Okay, yeah, this'll work. It's amazing how relative deprivation in gunfire change your attitude about things. Hm, there's barbed wire there; I guess... Jesus... Okay, I think I should just jump it, in case there's a mine right next to it because that's something I would do. All right. A little close there. Don't want to floss with this stuff. Oh, my God, it's like twenty degrees cooler down here. Oh. Of course. I'm not even surprised, I just forgot. I think there's sand in my suit. For somebody who's not escaping from prison, it sure feels like I am. Well, I'm not going anywhere. I have time to try and wedge this thing open. Should be able to do it in under an hour. No. That puts me ahead of schedule. See, this is why unions were formed. So, when you get lucky breaks like this, management doesn't make three seconds the new standard for opening a welded gate. Yeah, try following me through this drainage pipe, flyboy. I don't think so. Sadly, I am noticing a pattern here. I seem to be going back and forth between wanting nothing more than to get above ground then, once I do, there's something so bad happening topside that it makes me wish I was never born and I go back underground again. Man, fuck Groundhog Day! It's getting worse, too. I'm reasonably certain there's going to be an active volcano outside if I do this enough times. Yeah, okay, see, what's that? Are they spraying nerve gas? Waaah! COME ON! Why is the drainage pipe that's been welded on one end being guarded? And you're beeping. That's like a death sentence right there. Did I get it? It stopped. I don't know, I like to be sure about these things. Close enough. Okay, so, uh... Watch your step. Jesus, this is pretty high up. Oh, perfect! That's good! I needed something to take my mind off of death. Echo! You know, I have the height advantage here, so that means my bullets are traveling a little faster than yours. What'd you say to me?! Actually, it doesn't matter. I've got the best comeback of all: a SPAS-12. What? What was that? Didn't catch that. Yeah, don't have anything to say now, do you? I actually don't hold a grudge against someone talking trash about me if they're shot afterwards. I try to rise above that and find my own peace. Damn! I am high up. I don't even see an obvious way down. Besides, well, the obvious. Okay, I think this will do it. Yuaaah! Christ... Oh, man, just one trip up here and that's all it takes to-- Uh...anyway... I'm not an anthropologist, but I don't know any modern cliff-dwelling societies. I'm sure the first settlers probably thought it was a good idea because they have good defense, but once little Billy starts playing near the cliff, then there's no more little Billy. Then little Suzy and little Timmy fall off, which doesn't help the situation. I think those societies are all extinct now. Waah! Whuuuahh! Whuuuh... Oh, man that was so sneaky of you. Getting me to kill you so that the kickback from my gun could've knocked me over the edge. That was clever. If I hadn't braced myself, it might've worked. So, I guess you're just hiding in a hole in the rock, huh? Were those your orders, or was that your own initiative? Oh, man. Where are you guys coming from? If you're trying to do the same trick as the last guy, you're doing it wrong. It doesn't work at your angle. At best, I'll only get knocked back towards the wall. I don't know why I'm even explaining this to you. Hm, I'm really tempted to slide down that pipe like a banister but I think I'll regret it as soon as I get to the end of it. I'll find another way. Seriously, how are these soldiers getting here? Parts of this trail are narrow enough that I'm afraid to sneeze. Yet, they're sprinkled all over and stuck in rocks. Maybe they're still recruits and this the last part of their training. And Command just dumps them out of a plane and tells them to make their way back to base. No actual plan as to how they're supposed to get off a cliff. Just ingenuity. Whoever doesn't die in the process passes the training. If two-thirds of the recruits die or get stranded, then it's labeled as "intensive training". I bet there's a bunch more of these guys stuck in the canyon below. All right... This looks like our best candidate for not...dy-uhhhh... Okay, careful descent... no breakdancing moves. Here we go. Daaahh! Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah- dah-dah-dah... Good to be on this... THIS ISN'T A PATH! If I'm going the wrong way, I have problems. Oh, whoa! Okay, I think I've determined the cause of death. That's two of them. Maybe hiding in holes really were their orders. Why? Yeah, I'm not getting gun out. Uhh...huhh... Aaah! If the soldiers wanted to kill me, they could've just dumped a bucket of gravel right here. Dead. I guess I shouldn't be thinking about that, but I'm pretty sure they can't read my mind. WAAAAH! Hell, I can't read my mind. Wait... maybe. Speaking of mind-reading, one thing that pisses me off are those tinfoil hat people. They don't know what they're talking about. Hold on, I've got to concentrate. Make sure I don't die. I do that sometimes. EEHHH! But, yeah, assuming mind-reading is possible--which is big assumption--then... What the fuck is this? Is this seriously the bridge to the other side? I'd expect better than this from a Peruvian burrow trail. Jesus Christ! Why not just put up a sign that says, "Die"? What the fuck? These pipes look professionally built. How did that happen? Not like this! The wood's rotting, the stakes look rusted... I don't know how the soldiers got here, but it wasn't this way. Or, maybe it was; that's why so many of the planks are missing. If I had a grappling hook, I could just tie off, rappel down, and be done with it. Actually, maybe not. I'd have to be carrying a hell of a lot of rope. Well, they did use aircraft cable; I'll give them that. So, there's more support if I walk on the sides, since the boards look like they have the tensile-strength of rice cakes. I'm probably overreacting. OH NO, IT'SHAPPENINGAAAAAYAAHHHH! In retrospect, maybe I should've checked to see if the soldiers had any rope on them. I could've tied at the bridge and... But wait, look at these stakes. They're practically on the edge of the rock. They could've just popped out. Well, at least no one's following me. Unless the cliff is following me. No, that'd be a lot louder. Actually, I'm going to use the pistol; this is kind of unwieldly right now. I'm so high up... I didn't realize Black Mesa was literally built into the mesa. I guess that makes my Indian Burial Ground theory less likely. I'll take that... Oh wow. Yeah, I'm going to trust this catwalk with my life. Because, I'm sure it's different from every other catwalk I've walked on at this company. Actually, it is different. The other ones had guardrails. I think I'll stick with the rock. At least I know it's been built to code. If a spider jumps on me now, I'm going to have to be careful not to freak out. I could fall off. I don't think there are many spiders out here, though. Wait, you're not a spider. Okay, careful! I could fall off! Careful! What the hell are you doing?! I could slip on these shells! You ever think of that?! No! Of course not! As usual, I'm the one who has to think of these things. Whoa-ho! Motion-sensor doors. This is a step up from the death-slide trail. Is that...? Oh my God, it's a rocket launcher. The perfect gift for the man who has everything. Ooooh... you and I are gonna go places. My mind is spinning with new possibilities. You are the first good news I've had all day. Yes, I'll bring your friends. Locked! Hark! Dost thou hear with thine ears what I hear with mine? Interloper! No quarter shall be shown hither, fiend! Anon! Show thineself, churl! Have at thee! BLACKGUARD! AAH! FIE UPON ME! But ho! The laser on mine rocket launcher be not a mere target, but a guidance system. Where art thou?! Come hither that I may smite thee! Thou shalt not be missed. That was liberating. Whoa, wait, what's that sound? Do you hear that? I think that's silence! THAT'S THE SOUND PEOPLE MAKE WHEN EVERYONE TRYING TO KILL ME IS DEAD! AND I HAVE A ROCKET LAUNCHER! I HAVE A ROCKET LAUNCHER WITH A LASER-GUIDANCE SYSTEM! And...I'm walking on... a really... ...really... ...narrow cliff-face. Wuuahhh... Hmm. Besides seeming like a gift from the gods, this rocket launcher gives me some food for thought. I may have to revise my theory about the universe wanting me dead. If that was true, the rocket launcher would never have happened. Only most of the universe wants me dead. There's some larger game going on here. I'm more like Perseus or Odysseus caught in the center of some cosmic politics. That's too bad; I was hoping the universe would end with me. Maybe there's still a way to make that happen. Hmm. I feel like I'm forgetting something important. Mind reading! That was it. Okay, let's assume it exists, even though the transmission doesn't show up on any known spectrum. The tinfoil hat people. What do they think? That it's electromagnetic radiation? Then what do they think the tin is going to do? Whuh-huh-AHHHH! AAAAHHH! AAAAHHH! AAAAHHH! AAAHH! AAH! Ah... Th-that-that step was a little tricky. Oh God...oh God! Oooohhh... So, anyway, if it's electromagnetic, you'd need a Faraday Cage to block that and a tinfoil hat doesn't act like one. It's not even grounded. In all likelihood, a chunk of metal on your head is going to conduct any signal you're worried about, not block it. You'd have better chances with a lead helmet coated in rubber. Tinfoil hat people are ignorant. OH GOD! JESUS! YEAH! TORO, MOTHERFUCKER! Splat! Forget the mind-reading I just want a helmet. Cranial protection against punctures and lacerations. And bullets. Hmm. Well, I'm not wasting a rocket on the chance that there might be another one of those things in here. I guess I'll just do things the potentially painful way. If the circumstances were different, this area would actually be a pretty kick-ass place to build a waterslide. If this suit has a GPS tracking system, how come I can't see where I am? I guess it's an anti-theft feature. I would've stolen this a long time ago if I realized how functional it was. Okay, which way? Red... or red? Or, the other wa-- no, wait. I came from there. Shit. Red, it is. Oh, nice. It looks like someone started on my water park idea. I guess this would be for tubing beginners? Oh, I know. I bet you alternate the flooding from different tubes so you get knocked around from the different torrents. I like where they were going with this. They need to expand the length of the canals, though. All... quiet... And get rid of the special forces unit. That's going to make for a shitty theme for a water park. The customers shouldn't have to be packing heat in order to finish the ride. I really am kind of surprised these guys haven't given up by now. I mean, sure, they're following orders, so they're not going to give up. But, who's in charge? If I was running this thing, I would go and-- movement... over... Good, they didn't see me. I guess they thought the water splashing was a fish. But, yeah, whatever the name of this mission originally was, it's probably being called Operation Fuckup by now. If I was in charge and one man was killing every single soldier I sent to kill him, I would try something else. Hell, I could BE a general; I have enough combat experience by now. I'm going to sing about it. They can't stop me. Ahem... I am the very model of a modern Major-General I have information vegetable, animal, and mineral I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical. I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical About binomial theorem, I'm teeming with a lot o' news With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse. WHERE'S MY CHORUS?! I'm very good at integral and differential calculus I know the scientific names of beings animalculous In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral I am the very model of a modern Major-General. I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous. You know, this song is kind of dated. It's supposed to be MODERN Major-General... I'm going to add a new verse. I can fire at a target and hit it at least half the time Or graph out an electron path while using only numbers prime I calculate the fall rate of a bullet shot a thousand yards And perforate the thick heads of a hundred military guards. I can make a simulation of an atom bomb and build one, too Or flank a dozen men and ambush ten of them out of the blue From SMGs to RPGs, I carry quite an arsenal And skip around a warzone like a subatomic particle. STILL NO CHORUS! Okay, c'mon! Sing and I won't kill you! ...those of you that are left, I mean... Ah. Okay, there we go. Ahem... Every soldier out here wants to kill me for my curiosity I wage war on the whole damned world because of my tenacity In matters combat tactical and physics theoretical I am the very model of a modern Major-General. All right, no one else is even TRYING to sing along. I quit. Okay, delivery for Mr. Abrams. Oh, c'mon, I know someone's home. No, I don't need a signature. You have a nice day. Ah, button! Oh, good. Yeah, I kind of what to keep moving. I get the feeling someone may have heard the sounds of multiple tank shots and the tank exploding. Sometimes people investigate that sort of thing. Yeah! Yeah! I think I'm under investigation. On the plus side, this guy is shooting rockets. That means if I die, I'll see it coming. That's cool, right? I'm trying to find the silver lining here! There's not much! I bet you didn't know I could dance, did you?! Hey, what's up guys? You hanging out? That's cool. I'm not intruding or anything, am I? I figure you guys are cool and all. I'm just going to kind of chill out here if that's cool. I figure it's like my place is your place and the other way around and stuff, so I'm just cashing in on that. Hey, I'm just going to borrow this gun. I'll give it back, I swear. You can ask anybody, I'm good for it. I just need it for a little bit. Like, you won't believe this but there's like this big misunderstanding and something going on with me. I know, right? And I have to set the record straight and stuff so you know how that is. Like, I don't know what this guy's deal is but he's really pissed at me like I was trying to start something with him. As if! I mean, everybody knows me and I would totally not do something like that. So, this is all bullshit. Like, I've never tried to piss anyone off in my life, so why should I start with him? Does he think he's special or something? Because he's not. I just don't go around doing someth- ...shit. That's the problem with tanks: they're designed for this. It's a shame I have to take out this tank, because, man, if I could convince operator to just walk away and give me the keys, then game over. I could be like that dude in San Diego who stole a tank and the entire police force couldn't stop him. He was mental, too. Ohhhh! What happened?! Besides me being awesome! I was hoping to hit the operator, but obviously something else happened. If I had time, I'd love to do a ballistics simulation to try and come up with a theory as to how shooting a tank with bullets can make it explode. It must've ricocheted and ruptured a shell lying around. You can't BUY that kind of luck. You just have to be me. Nice. Motion-sensored rusted garage door. Wow. My knees are wobbly again. Wonder why that is. I think I'm just going to take a break in case there's another tank aimed at me right outside the other door. Besides, this looks like a party room, anyway. Yeah, if I was a general, I would just use nerve gas and be done with it. I don't even have a helmet. They can't figure that out. Fuck it. Hm, if I was hardcore, I'd be able to roll my Rs when I sang the song. Generaaall... Gen'rrrrrll... Generrrlll... Gen[chokes] ...I-I can't do it. I guess that's why I'm not a REAL general. They can probably all sing properly. So, back to the trenches for me. Literally. I guess this really is my new job now: killing people. I've had worse. Good. No tanks. Cleaning out grease traps-- Whoa! What is-- YEAH! HOW DO YOU LIKE EARTH'S GRAVITY?! NICE PARACHUTE! HEY, A PLANE! OVER HERE! The plane ignored me. Maybe the Air Force isn't in on the same conspiracy to kill me. Well, I shot at it. That's what you're supposed to do to signal rescue choppers, right? Or maybe that's just in the south. I know that's how they do it in Florida and Louisiana. So, another minefield. Is this sign bluffing? Prooooobably not! When the hell did they have time to plant a minefield around here anyway? It must've been a rush job. They probably didn't even make a map. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I'll bet anything those mines aren't documented. That means in 20 years, some documentary maker's going to come here and get his legs blown off trying to film this place. Here's to you, future dude. Oh! There's-- JESUS CHRIST! THAT DEBRIS COULD'VE TRIGGERED THE TRIPMINE! CLEARLY WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH REGULAR MINES FOR THIS SIDE, SO WE ADDED SOME EXPOSED ONES NEXT TO FALLING RUBBLE! BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BOMBED THIS PLACE ENOUGH ALREADY, IS THAT THE IDEA?! OH MY GOD! IS THERE A SQUIRREL UP THERE ON THE ROOF OR SOMETHING?! This could be payback...?! I don't see anything. I don't understand why we have all these tripmines. I guess the idea is if an alien comes by here... ...we blow it up and the side of a building. Oh, this one's sneaky; trying to trip me. What? OH GOD, NO! NOT NOW! WuuaaaAAAAA-AAA-AAA! This must be how old people feel about stairs... Oh, another dead guy. That's nice... Well, he didn't die from a mine; he still has all his body parts attached. Maybe-- WAAAAHHH! WAAAHHH! WAAAAH-WOOH-WEEHH-WAAA! WAAH...! Oh my GOD, that was close! Wait, is this that same sniper from last night? Is he following me?! I knew it! That guy is fucking evil! He shot at me and practically herded me into this tripmine here. Vicious... Hello! RRRAAAAAAAGHHHHH! Why is this door to nowhere locked?! Are they afraid people were going to drive through here and park on the minefield? I guess that is a valid concern! Well, I'm not walking through the God-damned minefield so I've got a problem! I'm not going to climb this ramp; sniper'll pick me off for sure! And this suit is still blaze-fucking-orange! I haven't been shot enough times to wear all the paint off yet! Looks like this door is my best chance, even though I have no reason to think it's unlocked. I guess I'll just... wing it if it doesn't work. Whoa-whoa-whoa. Wake up! Yeah, that's kind of where my life is right now, where I know my best option isn't going to work. Okay, so let's go and NOT do this! Yep, it's fucking locked. Zig-zag, zig-zag, zig-zag, zig-zig-zag-zagzagzigizz... Hah...that could've gone worse. Any day where you don't have your brains painted against the wall isn't all bad. Well, YOU know what I'm talking about. Okay, surely a sniper can't hit a moving target... Good... Yeah, I better stay out of there. I didn't realize this was a sniper preserve. That must be what all the landmines are for: to keep them from wandering into the residential areas. It's for their own protection just as much as ours. If we let them run free, then they'd snipe everything in sight and run out of the bullets. It would disrupt the ecosystem. Yep, see, I hear them. Oh, wow. Looks like I made the right call not tiptoeing through the minefield. I don't think I could jump to that fence from here. And, if they were smart--which is a big "if"--but, if they were, it would put the mines right at the fence where I would land. That's what I would do. Okay, so what's the plan now? Besides more sunburn? Ah, that'll work. I don't even have to be Jackie Chan to do this one, which is good for...obvious reasons. Okay, so the aliens don't come from a swamp planet, but their gravity has to be lower than ours. That flier dropped off aliens while it was two stories in the air--just fucking free-falling. Apparently, they saw no problem with that. That's considered normal and perfectly safe where they come from. Holy crap! So, if I had made it passed the minefield, then I would've had to climb through barbed wire so I could be electrocuted. Jesus, I don't think they have to worry about coyotes digging through the trash around here. And I'm sure that door is to a room filled with candy and treasure, but getting there is just not happening. I bet the soldiers would put landmines on the roof if they could. Just to be sure. All right, this looks like my entrance. ...if I had an acetylene torch... I still can't get over the aliens jumping from that height. Are the aliens bad at math? I guess it's possible; they only have three fingers and we have five. Nobody believes me, but I think we'd be farther along technologically if we had six fingers on each hand. I mean, for God's sake, the gene for polydactyly is dominant. I have no doubt that-- WHOA, what am I doing? Not getting shot, I think that's what I'm doing. Yeah, there's people that give you the evil eye, and then there's snipers. Big difference. But, yeah, I feel certain working with a duodecimal system would make us better people. I think we'd all be surprised how many of our problems would be solved if we all had twelve fingers. Okay, this looks like my ticket. Oh! We've got a live one. Hey! Make any sudden movements and I'm going to shoot you, okay? Okay. What's up? Me. I have no idea. Boxes... Man, if it's worse than what I've seen it must be silverback gorillas with flamethrowers. Well, I'll be honest with you. I was thinking about shooting you just to be safe, but I decided maybe killing scared unarmed people doesn't make me the good guy. So, if you're waiting here, do you have a deck of cards, or what? Oh, hey, how many fingers do you have on your hands? Okay, so you don't have ANYTHING, do you? No food, water, guns... I'll be blunt: you're not selling me on the "Wait Here" plan. I'd say that I'd think that this is going to get worse before it gets better, but really, I think this is just going to get worse forever. So, in other words, I think it's going to get worse before it gets worse. If you bet on that, I think it's pretty safe money. Hah! Hah! Hah! Okay... Hey, there's nothing here, man! Except for the tripmine... But, y'know, if you don't bother them, they don't bother you. There's no... I... I don't... What is this? Hey, you said take ONE LOOK out this door, and now... I was expecting... clowns...? I don't know. He's just trying to trick me. LIKE EVERYONE ELSE! I should've just shot him. Well, he'll be dead soon enough anyway. He's the man with the plan and no food or water. Why did they put mines near the ceiling? Well, anyway, the "Wait Here" plan only takes you so far. In fact, it doesn't take you anywhere. It might've been a good plan yesterday. Damn, lot of lasers. Why is this guy smoking? Did somebody shoot him in the back? IT WAS YOU! Okay, another one of you-- okay, stay still. Don't move-- no, don't do that-- see, you shouldn't-- NO! DON'T J--! DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN! If you don't teach them, they'll never learn! God, that thing almost tripped the laser. Why are there so many lasers here? I feel like I'm trying to steal a diamond. Wait, are there diamonds here? That would turn my day right around. WHOA! Whoa... Not that way. That way's a shortcut to a place I don't want to go. Yuck. Yeah, that's really all I have to say on the matter. Locked... Oh, wait, I've been here before. This is the door by the mines and the... pain... Jesus! There's rockets in here. I wonder they're just the chassis or if they're totally fueled up next to these mines. Hell, knowing us, they're fueled up and the warheads are still active. And we have extra fuel barrels just in case. Yeah, wow, look. They just slapped the mines on everything in sight. A loose crate, add a mine. Some metal railing, add a mine. A mop handle, add a mine. This room confirms every single thing I've suspected about the soldiers. This is their grand strategy at work, right here. Just slapped easily triggered mines on everything in a room that could wipe out half the facility if there was a chain reaction. Oh, and leave some aliens hopping around in it higgledy-piggledy, too. Yeah, there are NO surprises here. Just blow up everything in sight. Don't worry about how we do missile research here. Now, why is THIS guy smoking? Does he have any money? No... I should give the soldiers THAT much credit. Where am I? Oh. What is this? It has holes in it like spikes are gonna come out of it. And it has yellow/black caution lines. Can I trigger it? Why would me make something like this? Wait, what am I saying? That's the wrong question to be asking in this place. Although, it leaves me damned curious what you would tell other people that it's for. I mean it shoots spikes up out of the ground. Do we use it to kill cattle? I guess you could-- oh. I am NOT... no. But, yeah, are they actually going to kill a cow with that? That's crazy! It would hit its legs first and could easily miss its brain. It would just make horrible noises and be in as much pain as possible. Okay, so I guess that's why we made it. Solved that one. I don't get it. Why did they need this to lift into the computer room? And where are the spikes? Are they on a time-delay? I better get off this. Maybe the spikes haven't been installed yet. I wonder if I can just position one of these missiles and ride it out of here. Nah, I would die on impact. All right... Guess it's time to check out what the seizure button does... Jeez, that's fast! Wait a minute, that guy saw all these mines but he's just hiding in the next room? He thinks that's safe? Why would anyone think that? He should be running from here as far as he can! What is that?! Space larva? Friggin'... death worm? Ehhh... Well, it's evil, I know that much, so... So, did I kill it? Or do I need to take this up a notch? No, I think I got it. It's dead. Dead. OH! WHAT THE FU--! Fuckin' dumbass! He ran right in front of my sh-- Jesus Christ! See, this is why I don't have friends! All they ever do is run around screaming causing problems for everyone, until somebody tries to kill them. Friends are like weeds that scream. Hey, the lights are on. Tell me the keys are in here. Tell me the keys are in the ignition! NO! DAMMIT! THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL ME! Rrrrrr! My lack of preparedness is biting me in the ass AGAIN! I've always meant to learn how to hotwire a car. I never got around to doing it--that crap is all on the Internet now--there's NO excuse. And let's face it, this is not a Porsche with a laser-cut key. Ah, hell with it. It didn't have a steering wheel anyway. Maybe I should shoot the tires just out of spite. Huh? MILITARY CAR ALARM! Now, I'm even more pissed about not being able to hotwire this truck! It had a turret-gun ready to fire in the back. That's WAY better than those beeping noises dump trucks make when they back up. Okay, I don't see anyone, but I'm expecting people dressed up in full concrete camouflage laid flush against the wall. I mean, there were fucking ninjas here last night, weren't there? Was that real? Of course, now that it's daytime, they've all disappeared. NOT WHAT I WANTED TO SEE! GOOD! Exactly as I planned! Shit. This was NOT part of the plan! YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! OH! Okay, I know what time it is. Because it's clearly rocket launcher time. However... Exactly. Mr. Dead-to-Rights, the tank operator, doesn't seem to operate in my time zone. His clock says it's time to turn me into red paste. Okay, time to reflect on my life choices again. That tank totally just shot and killed one of his soldier buddies without hesitation. Almost killed the other one. Man, I'm NEVER joining the military. I'm starting to wish I hadn't shot that security guard. His willingness to run in front of gunfire would be real handy right about now. I'd tell him to run out there first, I'd run the other way, it would be perfect. Teamwork: the ultimate sacrifice. Okay, time to go out in style. Zig-zag, zig-zag-- Is he going to blow through the building?! He doesn't have to! Personally, I would recommend he NOT blow through the building! I shouldn't even suggest that to him. Why is this door not moving?! It's blown off the hinges! I can see inside, for God's s...! THIS IS NOT LOCKED; THIS IS CHEATING! TELL REALITY TO STOP CHEATING! Reality, how could you? So, let's face the facts: I don't have a grappling hook to climb up the building, and this tank needs... seconds... to turn the barrel left and right, so that's my window of really shitty opportunity. Hey, I'm not here right now. This is my day off. So, don't-- No...! Okay, good, no second tank behind it. Oh yeah, what now, Captain Boom-a-lot?! How about you turn your gun towards me and kill yourself shooting the wall?! I'M RIGHT HERE, ASSHOLE! COME GET ME! THAT'S RIGHT, THIS SIDE! Okay, bye! Doop-boop-doop-boodloodlood-doop, doop-boop, boo-doo-boodloodlood, doop-boop, doopboopdoop... Oh God! Don't be a nuke! Don't be a nuke! I-I can't handle a nuke! Okay, I'm not blind and my face is still on my...face, so that probably wasn't a nuke. WAAAAGH! LOOK OUT! THERE'S A SNIPER OUTSIDE! I SAID, LOOK OUT! YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL! WATCH OUT OR HE MIGHT SHOOT YOU! LISTEN TO ME, I SAID THERE'S A SNIPER! I tried to warn them. Actually, I thought that second guy was going to run into his own grenade, but, I think he remembered about it at the last minute. Some people are destined for a special kind of greatness. Jesus Christ, this thing is loud. I could hear it outside the building. I'm going to turn it off. Dammit, it's not... I hit the switch, what else am I supposed to do? I wouldn't make a good surgeon. Hey, I just realized, I don't know how to fly a helicopter either. But, I think I should get a free pass on that one because it's unreasonable to anticipate... Okay, I'm going to let you live because I need you for an experiment to ascertain whether tank shells prefer blue or orange colors. Yes, that's good, you may call me "sir". Excellent. Okay chuckles, you wait there while I figure out where we're going. Okay, is this...? No. Oh, you want to take a shot, huh? Hey, speaking of initiative, I can't help but notice you were standing up here while I was screaming for help downstairs. Some people might look poorly upon that. Oh wow, grenades. I could've used these a few minutes ago. Guns! Shells! ...more guns! Holy crap, I've gotta find Eddie. If I can haul all of this stuff out of here later, this is my ticket to a new life. Okay, I guess I can get this guard to help me carry some of this stuff, but we should probably find a way out of here first so we can come back here with a truck. Seriously, this might be a war zone, but there is money to be made here! I don't know how many MP5s I've seen just lying on the ground. We might need a couple trucks. That guard knew the code to this place, maybe he knows other stashes just like this. He might just tell us; what does he have to lose? Eddie could interrogate him later if he doesn't, but one step at a time here. I'll just take what I can handle for now. I'll be using some of this just to get out of this madhouse. I don't have time to look through all these crates now. If it's anything like these shells, we're going to cash out. It already has! Don't you understand that? Forget it, all I need from you are the stash locations, okay? I'm not looking to split this share between anyone else besides Eddie anyway. I wonder if Eddie can even handle this much inventory. Fuck it, I know he'll try. I know Eddie. When I tell him about all I found that's just lying here for the taking, he's going to get that sparkle in his eye. It's that same sparkle he had before he going to Panama, and I remember how that turned out. Oh-ho-ho! I have not forgotten you. I mean WE haven't. I'm not really the sentimental type, but-- Well, no, I'm not. Okay, this must be the Sniper residence. I received a bullet delivery from you by mistake, so I'm returning it plus a little something extra for your trouble. Okay, I'll mark down that you received the shipment. Hey, you don't have a car, do you? That would make my life a lot easier, you have no idea. But, you probably don't; it got blown up...? Oh, so you don't know where you parked it, huh? Well, I can't blame you. If I knew where I was going, a few hundred people would be alive right now. But, they were all assholes, so... Yeah... So, what kind of car do you drive? I've been wanting to get a Crown Victoria from a police auction for some time now. I thought it would be cool to drive it around town with the police stripes, and splash some fake blood all over the hood. Now, what is with these doors? WHOA! Don't turn into one of THOSE people, man. Okay, guess we're going here. Rrr... We'd better be careful. Hey, I'm the leader. I need you to go find a camcorder. Then you can film me jumping around here and climbing on things. If we're lucky, we'll catch some explosions or jets flying in the background. Then I'll mix some music to it later; it'll look sweet. Hey, you coming or what? If he thinks I'm waiting on him, he's in for a surprise. So, this must be where that bomb hit. Why did they bomb this? It looks empty. Did they miss? Maybe they don't need a reason. Ohhh... They'll never think to look up! Yeah, try and advance on me from down there, surface-dwellers! Today's forecast is sunny mixed with raining bullets. Huh, so was this building bombed before or after there were troops inside it? Nee! I think it was after. Okay, how am I getting down? Uhhh... Oop-bop-paa! I've lost track of how many friendly-fire incidents I've seen the military commit by now, but a friendly-bombing is a new one on me. And those are just the ones I've seen. So, that means that the actual number of friendly-fire incidents is a lot higher. Anyone here? No? So, what happened with that bomber pilot? Did he just sneak a flask of whiskey up in the cockpit and take off? Maybe he decided to do a barrel roll when he released the bombs so they would fan out everywhere. And why shouldn't he if he's drunk? JESUS CHRIST! I almost shot you! And how'd that door open? Forget it; don't spook me like that! You're really making me think about bringing back the Kill Everyone policy I had going on. Waah! Okay... I think I know what we're going to do here. I mean, I think I know what I'm going to do here. You just... Yeah, you do that. On a lighter note: I never told you the second part of my plan. The cop car is just a beginning. The next part would take a while because I would have to pay somebody to train a chimpanzee in hardcore karate and attack people on sight. I mean, he would have to be loyal to me, of course--I'm the trainer-- but everyone else would get a beat down. Then we could ride around at night and I could just let him loose on the street for a while watching him beat the crap out of people. Nobody would be prepared for this. I could have a little whistle or something I could blow to get him to come back to the car. HELLO, THIS IS GROUND CONTROL. PLEASE APPROACH MY SIGNAL. DO YOU SEE MY SIGNAL? LET ME TRY ANOTHER ONE. HOW ABOUT NOW? DO YOU SEE THAT ONE? HELLO? NO, NO. PLEASE STAY INSIDE THE AIRCRAFT UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE LANDED. THANK YOU. HOLD ON, WE'RE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. EXCUSE ME, SIRS? SIRS? YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED BACK HERE. THANK YOU. OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHECK THESE THROUGH CUSTOMS. THIS IS GROUND CONTROL AGAIN. YOU'RE FLYING SOUTH. FOLLOW MY SIGNAL. IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO KEEP ON FLYING TO ANOTHER AIRFIELD, THAT'S FINE BY ME. JUST KEEP GOING...somewhere. WE'RE GOING TO NEED MAINTENANCE DOWN HERE. WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH THE HANGAR DOORS. OKAY, YOU'RE HEADING BACK EAST? AH, YOU'RE COMING AROUND. OKAY, LET'S LINE IT UP THEN. YOUR APPROACH LOOKS GOOD I'M JUST GOING TO GUIDE YOU IN. JUST FOLLOW MY SIGNAL. LOOKING GOOD! PERFECT! Welcome to New Mexico. Ground temperatures are 88 degrees with clear skies. Thank you for flying with us. Those aircraft didn't have the best safety records anyway. I don't need to be checked by Security; I work here? Thank you. Well, I don't want to go in there anyway! Yep, have shotgun, will travel. One thing I don't-- WAAH! Shit! Not again! Okay, walk away. I'm not getting involved anymore than I am already. It's not like I can get into any more trouble. What do I care? I launched a missile. Besides, I FUCKING TOLD HIM NOT TO DO THAT! So, what does he do? He does it again. That's the story of humanity right there. He didn't even find a camcorder. Okay, accident or not, I've killed so many people at this point, I have to be changing the course of history. I've mostly been killing soldiers, though, and they're not as likely to change history unless it's a really decisive battle. Or maybe if they're smart and go on to do important things later in life, but... no, there's no risk of that. I haven't killed any smart ones. Okay, is this really locked solid? No, I think these joints are loose. Yeah, yeah, I just have to work this here. I can pry it open. Waah! There's a reason that door's locked! Fucking... bees? Is that all this is? I'M NOT ALLERGIC TO BEES, ASSHOLES! And they die on impact; they don't even swarm. Are they toxic? I don't think so. Earth bees are more hardcore than space bees. I guess the conventional wisdom is true. OKAY, EVERYBODY SETTLE DOWN! DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?! YOU NEED TO SPEAK UP! WHAT?! I CAN'T HEAR YOU! YOU WANT ME TO SHOOT YOU?! SURE, I CAN DO THAT! IS THAT ENOUGH?! OKAY, I'LL KEEP IT COMING! HOW ABOUT NOW?! IS THAT GOOD?! HELLO?! Yeah, I think that's good. They would let me know if there was a problem. Well, I've gotta say, the soldiers picked the right spot for building a gunner's nest. I'm starting to think the teleportation isn't so random. I don't know, it's just a hunch I have. Jesus, how many was that? Twenty? Well, it's a total waste. We need to be moving in here with rubber suits and hooking these guys up to a power plant. Maybe I can come back here and capture one; use it to power a cabin. I could really live off the grid then. Okay, this way's not happening. Hey, what is this pink... volcano anyway? It looks like the asphalt has cancer. Okay, good. That means that the Earth... isn't... alive. OH GOD! NO! I'M NOT A LOTTO BALL! THE LAST TIME I GOT JUGGLED THROUGH THE AIR, IT WAS HORRIBLE! YOU'RE THE REASON WE HAVE NAPALM! THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR BEING WHAT YOU ARE! Oh no... Oh, they're fighting each other! Wow... This must be, what, the second time now? Y'know, maybe it's even the third. And bullets win again. Who would've thought? Hey, you're the winner! You won! Oh! And you, too! It was a team effort! Everybody wins! Especially me. Hey, I just realized, if a soldier assassinated somebody important, they could also change the timeline that way. But, if they can't get past me, can they really get past Secret Service or private security? Their targets won't be blaze-orange like me. But, does the universe really care about our timeline, anyway? I think we're giving ourselves a bit much credit here. Shit... Gah! GOD! Well, maybe... If Booth hadn't shot Lincoln, this might not be happening. No! NO! No... So, uh, case in point, since we know extraterrestrial life now, that means, statistically, there's probably billions of worlds with life. So, we could blow up our own planet on this timeline and the universe doesn't really care. I spaced out again, didn't I? Hey, how are ya doing? I'm from Maintenance? I heard you're having some trouble with the ventilation in here? I don't think they believed me. Well, it's hard to think of excuses when people are shooting at you inside a ventilation shaft. I had the same problem in high school. Holy crap! What the fuck just happened there? I opened the door and they tossed in the explosives immediately-- before they even saw me, especially with the sun outside. How did they know I wasn't a wounded soldier exiting? I guess they just didn't give a shit, which seems to be the answer to everything the military does. Hey, does this-- It's just a big button! Step right up! This is amazing! WOW! Okay, guys, I think that's enough; I don't know how many shells are in this thing. Okay, so we have some more dead people. But, we've established that I can murder an unlimited number of people and the universe won't be affected in any measurable way. I'm definitely affecting the human timeline, though, but again, how much? Because, say one of these guys will invent a... quantum communicator, and I just shot him, was he really our only hope? In terms of probability, won't some other guy in Australia just invent a quantum communicator three years later? Oh, good. Good, good, good, good, good. Carry on; I'm just an impartial observer. Pretend I'm not even here. I'm very impressed with how things are proceeding. I'll have good things to say in my report. HEY, I SAID PRETEND I'M NOT EVEN HERE! Okay, well this guy's going to cost you a few points, but other than that, very high marks. When I file the-- Hey, you're late. You think I don't see that? This is going in my report. There! I punched your timecard for you. Now, get back to work. Maybe I'm not as impartial as I think I am. Wait a minute; I have to be! I don't even know what's going on! Y'know, for this not being my fight, an awful lot of people want to kill me. Or, not just me, everybody wants to kill everybody, except me wanting to-- ah, fuck it. I'm so confused. This is kind of like shotgun chess where I need to kill them in the right order. Or else... See, I did it wrong. Okay, check... Dammit, I didn't see the bishop. I don't like chess. See, the problem with chess is it all comes down to who can think more moves ahead, and not in a clever way. You could be Einstein or Tesla, but you're always going to lose to that psycho who memorizes board positions and can remember fifty moves in his head. Waaahh... Computers can beat us in chess because it's a game meant for computers. I don't like games that are about who can memorize the most crap, because that's what it is. It's not like memorizing chemical bonds in the periodic table, which has a shitload of applications. Memorizing chess plays are only about moving pieces around to feel smug about it. Hm, I guess that's why it's so popular. Well, speaking of stalemates, I'm kind of undecided about who to be shooting here. Oh! Besides you! No... Because, let's face it, I want the soldiers and aliens to just kill each other. Or, more specifically, stop shooting me. Now, if I had to choose, the knee-jerk reaction would be I want the soldiers to win, but do I really? The aliens mostly just bees and electric shocks, and while that's really fucking annoying and painful, it's not bullets. Plus, if the soldiers win, I still lose; I'm a fugitive. Okay, I don't know where I'm going. Uhh... Okay, I guess I'm going to have consort with the dark powers here because I'm out of ideas. Okay, thank you, O Dark Ones. I pay homage. Now, where's that straggler? He's upsetting the delicate balance of not being dead. Yep, more bees. Yep. You think you're the scariest person that's followed me?! Raahh... Okay, here, I have an idea: Why don't you go and take a look at-- Shit. No, don't look at that. That's... Well, I can't just walk away; he's seen me. That means I'm going to wake up three days from now with him standing over me in my motel room. Nnnyaaah... There, that should give him something to think about. Yeah, see, if the aliens win, not only will the charges against me be forgotten, but they're not too bright. Their most devastating weapon is being able to teleport anywhere, and they're not using that anywhere near its potential. What is this? So, this weird tunnel goes to something f-- Uhh... Aaah-ha-ha... Oh, okay. I refuse to believe that is the only purpose of this horizontal pipe with a small pool. Oh... shit... Oh... man... Well, at least they didn't tell me to put that in my pipe and smoke it. You know what I like about being hopelessly trapped HERE compared to other places? I'm not going to immediately die. That room that was underwater? I was going to run out of air in MINUTES, or being pinned down by artillery fire. Jesus! This is downright peaceful. STILL WANT TO GET OUT, THOUGH! What the f...? So, how did THAT happen? Was it a ghost? Wooo-ooo-oo! I'm a ghost! Wooooo! I'm a ghost with a shotgun! I'm going to haunt... the shit out of you! Okay, so, seriously, what the hell happened? Did a ghost let me out of that pipe? Let's examine the evidence. That hatch was sealed shut when it opened. I saw nobody there, so either one of the soldiers unlocked it, then sprinted away around the corner and then turned his back to me, or else it was a ghost. I suppose it could've been a time-delayed opening like a bank vault, but wow, I really doubt that. No, I think a ghost just let me out of there like Jack Torrance in "The Shining". Where am I going? So, a ghost let me out. Does that mean I have to kill people now, or... wait. Oh, there's another pipe. Yeah, why not? I won't get stuck. The ghosts have my back now. Wish they'd showed up sooner. Yeah, look at this hatch. There is NO WAY something like this opens up by accident. So, it's confirmed: I've been chosen by ghosts. Well, in "The Shining", they let him out so he could kill his family, but that doesn't really apply to me. Maybe I've been looking at this the wrong way. I'm doing the world a FAVOR by killing these people, because I'm stopping their horrible timelines from continuing. I don't know... I mean, the ghosts haven't been especially clear with me what their message is, so if I get confused and kill a bunch of people, am I really to blame? Y'know... ...I don't think I am. And I'm not hearing any contrary opinions, so I guess it's unanimous. Okay, so if I have ghosts watching me, I have to be careful not to get too cocky, because they like to get your back and then just drop you. Wait, I'm not a ghost, am I? No. Okay, let's all stay on the same page here. Now, what I could REALLY use from the ghosts is for them to leave me some car keys, and the car... WUAAAAH! Okay... the ghosts aren't telling me to kill you, so I guess you get to join the Freeman Fan Club. Oh, you're not going to die ALONE, don't worry about that. We have that problem covered. Oh, and don't be discouraged by the fact that everyone who HAS followed me is dead or stranded right now, because that's mostly not my fault. In the rare event it WAS my fault--yeah, go and open that-- it still wasn't REALLY my fault. See, the thing is, I have high standards and a lot of people don't live up to them. And, for some reason, many people don't believe me when I say we need to do something and end up facing the consequences. What I'm saying here is, people who don't listen to me tend to die, alright? Okay, shut up, we've gone in circles again. Okay, there are sandbags right fucking here. Do you see this? Nope. I am not impressed, man. Okay, we are NOT off to a good start here. First, you lead me in circles, now you're complaining your feet hurt after two minutes of walking. Is this what is called "learned helplessness"? I've heard of that before. Oh, and don't walk on this thing. Not that you're going to do anything I say, but... yeah, you're going die, I can see that right now. Oh, you know the code! That's great. Your death will go towards a greater good. Y'know, me. Now, don't expect a statue or anything, unless you make it yourself, but with all the bombing, there's not really much point. Oh, boy! This is the wrong way! NOW'S YOUR CHANCE! SHOOT HIM! YOU SHOOT HIS ASS! GOOD! FUCKING DO IT! Another gate... I don't think I can smash through this one even though I have a running start. Okay, time for the asphalt tumor ride. It's not working--WAAAAAHHHH! WUAAAH-WAAAAH-AAAAAH! That worked out okay... Is someone following me? Oh, it's dead man walking. Bye! Waaaah! Sir, yes sir! What does this do? Oh! Oh, I'll give you targets. Does this do what I think it does? Amazing! I didn't even see the plane. Uh-oh. Maybe I shouldn't have done that. Oh, shit, that buckled fast. Uh, yeah, let's do it again. Yes, walk into it! Good Godzilla! THAT'S A GOOD GODZILLA! YES, THAT'S A GOOD JOB! Wow. Lucky that thing doesn't have a fear response. Most animals have that. I guess the thought something kicking its ass just confuses it. So, let's bomb something else. I've got time for this. I'll make time. That looks good... I guess... Oh, man, nothing. That must be SERIOUSLY reinforced, like those rubber alloy walls they use on nuclear reactors. Well, let's try and take out that radio tower. I think LESS communication is BEST communication. Yeah, there we go. Nothing again? These are some surgical strikes! I actually am pretty amazed at the accuracy of these pilots. Ohhh! Yeah! Yeah, that's more like it. Now we're cooking with Composition H6. This is going to solve my problems. When all you have is aerial strike map, everything looks like a bomb target. Where's the plane? Oh, yeah, I could get used to this. I am again surprised there's no authentication here; just two big joysticks and a red button. I guess the military understood the intelligence of the people they were working with. And that gate is still standing. Actually, why does this place have a moat to begin with? Ahahahaha! You know, this map is great, but it has one severe flaw and that it's too small. I need one of the whole world. I can't bring it with me so I guess I'll just keep heading to greener pastures. Although my "green pastures" are more like sunbaked badlands covered with bodies and alien growths. And mines. And people shooting at me. I really do like, however, how that officer said, "Forget about Freeman." I still think it's psychotic they've made me a priority, but calling it off is good. I just hope I'm not the only person who received those orders, because that would just be redundant. Uh, I didn't call this one in-- Yeah, I'm going to leave. I'm starting to get that feeling again like I don't belong here, and the irony is, I don't even want to be here. So, you think, I don't want to be here, they don't want me here, this problem should solve itself pretty rapidly, but it really seems to be persisting quite aggressively. Oh! We are not deep enough yet, are we? WAAAAH! HOLY SHIT! Oh, yeah! Go dark! That would make everything... perfect right now... If I couldn't see in the middle of all this, that would-- Don't crush me--THIS SUIT DOESN'T DO SHIT AGAINST 50 TONS OF ROCK! Is that gas filling the room? I don't know how I feel about that with those sparks up there. No, I DO know how I feel about that! See, this is why I like the pipe. Uh, ghosts? Any time now... Okay, I've decided it's not safe here. All this rock dust is a health hazard. I'm definitely not taking a nap here. At least I don't think that's natural gas leaking in here. It doesn't smell like it. Hey, maybe it's ether! Mmm! Oh, this is helpful. That's very considerate of the rock not to completely crush the exit. The bombings are less helpful. Wuahh...! Hey, did you hear that? They said, "Forget about Freeman." Hey, I wonder if I can delete myself as an employee. Probably not, but... no... This isn't-- Uh-oh. That guard has no idea how lucky he is. Well, he was bright enough to start shooting at it, I'll give him that. He's probably seen what these things do. Although, I have to say, I think this is just a taste of what the future holds. Like, right now, if you walk in the parking lot of Walmart, there are dozens of surveillance cameras watching you. I think in, maybe 50 years, there will also be roof-mounted turret guns in order to gun down shoplifters. Okay, Stumpy, you're my new bodyguard. Well, see, that was my first impulse, too, but I would advise against being a track star around here, what with all the lasers and mines and death-- Hup! See what I mean?! Hey, I don't know how much ammo you're carrying, but you can fire more shots than that. Those guys will crush our heads like grapes if we don't take them down. Do you understand? Your helmet's not going to stop them. It's giving you a false sense of security. I mean, look at this! Do you see this? Okay, try to keep up, alright? Shit... not this way... ...the other way... with the... no, bees... ...less bees... ...oh, more bombing! YES! NOW I'M COMPLETE! FUCK! I'M GETTING SANDWICHED! MOVE! This is such a busy day! See, chess doesn't prepare you for this. You can't say that a rook and three pawns flanked your knight, but he laid down suppressing fire and punched through them anyway. You get disqualified if you try that. Maybe I've been disqualified from reality. I mean, what is THIS? This isn't real, is it? How can I know? It's too easy to just explain all this away as aliens. It's aliens AND teleportation, and a conspiracy against me, and drugs, and in-house genocide, and ghosts, and now these cosmic disco balls. And I'm still hungry, dammit! Why don't the soldiers carry any MREs on them? What the fuck? Alright, well, mission accomplished, assholes, you make me not want to go this way. Ugh! Well, at best, this shit is harmless like shed skin or something, at worst, I'm dead already because of alien pathogens. Christ, another one. Although, I'm going to bet on "safe" because I'm guessing our DNA is so different, the alien viruses haven't had enough time to figure out what the hell they're dealing with yet. Well, this is the only way. Shit. No... NO...! I'M NOT YOUR MOTHER! STOP IMPRINTING! DON'T FOLLOW ME! STOP IT! BLAAAAAAAAAAH! I wouldn't make a very good babysitter. I mean, my first impulse towards seeing a bunch of kids run around is to throw things at them. I mean, not lethal or anything. God, how many of these things are there? So these are egg sac light shows. You know what? I'm me. Let's be smart about this. Yeah, that's good. But yeah, wouldn't all these flashing lights just attract predators? This seems like an evolutionary liability. Click! Okay, so what I'm seeing is NOT real. Either that or I've been tricked and these are actually just very elaborate fireworks. And this thing is floating in mid-air. That just now hit me. Let's be certain about this. Alright, so this IS real. Uh-oh. NO! I DON'T WANT YOU! STOP! Hey, what happened to that security guard who was supposed to have my back? He's probably just screwing around... Well, I'm not going back for him. He was firing so slowly you'd think he was loading black powder into the gun barrel between each shot. Maybe he reenacts battles-- Why do I feel like I'm fighting a dump truck? YAH! NNNNYAAA-AAAH! A howling dump truck full of... bees. It's all that armor they're wearing, but it's weird because it shows off their obvious alien pectoral muscles. That's not practical. That's the kind of armor a male stripper would wear. Are we being invaded by strippers? I assumed this invasion was the normal conquering variety, but maybe it has a strange kinky alien context. Okay, one more try. Yay! I win the nightmare piñata! These things shouldn't be out in the wild! We need to round them up for ring fights like any civilized society would! You start with small animals... move up to big... Dammit! ...then steadily increase the odds for bet payouts! They seem to combust quickly, though. They must be reacting to something in our atmosphere. Good! That's all I have to say about that. I hope there's something valuable down here, but what the aliens consider valuable-- Christ! How am I not deep enough yet?! Anyway, they probably consider slime mold valuable. AH! I'm here for the molds! And the fungus! I'VE GOT YOU PINNED DOWN! YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE WITH OUR MUSHROOMS, AND OTHER CRAP THAT GROWS IN CELLARS, ALIVE! Ergh! AAARGH! FUCKING BEES! Why is there--WUAAH! Yeah, this is just a storage lockup. Okay, time for round two. Whoa! I wonder if he actually is just guarding mushrooms. What? WAH! JESUS CHRIST! IT TELEPORTED RIGHT NEXT TO ME! THAT'S TOO CLOSE! THEY'RE GOING TO TELEPORT INSIDE ME! NO! TIME TO RETREAT! WHAT?! WHY IS HE NOT DEAD YET? DO I HAVE TO KILL EVERYONE AROUND HERE MYSELF?! GRAAAAARGH! Lead by example... I can't delegate anything. You know, being a one-man army isn't actually something you aspire to. You say that because it sounds bad ass, not because you LITERALLY want to function as an entire army! But, what are my options?! Do everything myself or just die! My opinion of humanity is so low right now. Or maybe not humanity but... everything. Okay, let's play this game! Bet somebody's wishing their shots fired a little faster. Which side am I on? Is it this one? Peek-a-boo! Okay, let's see what's so important they were putting up all these defenses. Is that the exit back there? They've got it blocked off; that must mean something. Wuah... What the hell?! It's just a corner! Fuck you and your stupid... webbing... shit! There's not a damned thing here! Oh, wait, there's one of these air things. Maybe there's an entrance up in the rafters? Well, there is an indentation. Let me check, that might be it! No! There's nothing! If I jump on that, all I'm going to do is brain myself. That's a lot of fighting I did just to clear out a worthless dead end. I thought for sure this was the way since the aliens clogged it up so much. This wouldn't be an issue if I had a map. Shouldn't there be fire exit maps around here periodically? I haven't seen anything and I've been doing a lot of wandering. So, what's the plan now? Everything here is a dead end! Do I really want to try and go back and dig through that fallen rock? Not that it will matter because it's pressed up against a steel door. "Stop". Oh, thanks, THANKS! Now I know what to do. If I'm trapped down here long enough, I'm going to have to start eating the aliens and I don't know how I'm going to cook them. I can't believe I cleared out that whole hallway for nothing. This is such a waste, too. I mean, the military is barely doing its job, but they could outsource this. Make a public announcement that every gun owner is welcome to come here and shoot aliens. Kill as many as you want. Militias dream of something like this happening. If we open this up, it would be like a modern-day pilgrimage for a third of the country. Hey, maybe there's a drainage pipe here. Gaaah... dahh! Bleugh... Oh, I forgot about this thing. So, what's this valve do? Drain the pond? Yeah, why not? I don't even have to touch the egg sac... Okay, let's... ...shit. NO! RUH-YAH-YAH-YAH-YAH-YAH-YAH-YAH...! Friggin'... popcorn bugs! Well, that actually went better than I thought, because, besides the fact that I don't have a screaming insect thing biting my face, it look like that doesn't drain the pond but opened up a hatchway instead. I guess it's sealed so that water doesn't seep in when it rains and floods the underground manmade pond here with no source of water, and this all makes sense because we're in the desert. Okay, so... I feel like there's something I should be doing. Whoa-WHOA! Okay, it's more about what I should NOT be doing! Not being shot hasn't changed! It was true yesterday, it's still true today! In fact, that's a life lesson you can take with you: Don't get shot. Ever. I am glad this thing shot the aliens, though, and it's not specifically programmed to only shoot me, because, frankly, that wouldn't surprise me at this point. Okay, this runs west to east, but I don't even know which way I've been going. I'll ask for directions. He doesn't know either. I'm gonna go another way. Okay... but these tunnels are completely gated off. So, yeah, that was a simple decision. I wonder if I'm being herded towards more danger. I mean, of course I am, but I wonder if it's deliberate. Shit... It was water all along. If I ever get out of here or find a copy of the blueprints, I bet I'm going to discover I've took the longest possible path through the facility. Some architect will look at the map and say, "Oh, you took THAT tunnel. "Yeah, that added two miles to your route." What was that? Hey, what...? Yep. Another shark. Of course. Hello! Yeah, I'm dead certain there were sharks here before this whole teleportation madness. I mean, I saw a shark cage; what more proof do I need? Yeah! You stay back in the pool! Nobody's evolving legs on my watch! Hey, that part looks shallow; maybe I don't HAVE to be a shark-hunter. That would definitely reduce my stress. Besides, what's the point if I don't have a trophy to show people? Yaah... I can't get the carcass stuffed; people will have to take me at my word I've killed sharks. I don't want to be that guy. Holy crap, it's a Charlie Chaplin cog. So, it's either this or the shark, huh? Oh, there's a gap. This is slow moving. WORMS! Bah! I am Captain Hydroelectric. At least I assume that's what this place is for. Why is this locked? This place is pretty remote; I bet there's skeletons inside. Ah! I hope I can find some gold teeth. Oh, so there's NOTHING. Yeah, I guess that should've been my first guess. Y'know, I have found explosives just lying on shelves or in boxes, but a hidden padlocked door contains absolutely nothing. I guess the idea is things are more secure if you do the exact opposite of what you should do? Hm. What the hell is this? Hey! I'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF THE WATER! WORMS EVERYWHERE! WORMS ARE GONNA GET ME! No, c'mon... Okay... gaahhh... ...c'mon! ...daah! ...gaaaahhhh! JESUS CHRIST! Are these worms even real or am I just going through withdrawal because I'm a bigger alcoholic than I thought? I don't drink THAT much, that's what pills are for. And, what the hell? This gear isn't turning anything! It's not just out of sync, there's literally nothing for it to turn! It's not a water wheel... there's no damned point to this thing at all! Oh, wait, I see. It must be here to crush the shark if it tries to swim up here. I get it now. Ah, okay. Paper beats rock. Hand-grenade beats unmanned sentry g-- Shit. Okay... that... was the rehearsal, so now let's do the real thing. Yeah! Y'know, I'm getting pretty tired of these explosives that don't actually do anything. Was there a mix-up at the factory and some kid with fireworks is getting his hands blown off right now? All right, let's do this the hard way. Maybe the grenades are like the bullets in Starship Troopers where they train with blanks but every 10,000th round is real. So, it's like that, but in reverse. Yeah, that shark's pretty wound up. I'm getting out of the water before it figures out how to jump the fence. Getting shot makes me upset, too. Oh, maybe he's here to feed the shark. Well, I can't endorse that. GO BACK! THE SHARK'S NOT WORTH IT! Uh... Christ. NOW, YOUR DYING WISH MAYBE FOR ME TO FEED YOU TO THE SHARK, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT! YOU'RE BETTER OFF LEAVING! Y'see? Man, I'm not even sure this guy was military. Maybe he's just a PETA-extremist that snuck in here. Oh. Rockets. Oh, wow. Yeah, I'll try and strap some more of these to me. Ahh, I don't think I can hold any more. I'll just need to find an excuse to use a rocket launcher. I could think of a lot of excuses. Okay, looks clear enough. God, they're still bombing? Well, these guys don't seem concerned about that, so that means I'm either clear of the bombing or else, they're incredibly stupid. Hmm. Daahhh! GAAAAH! Oh, shit! That's a tank! I wonder if anyone's operating it? Well, why take a chance? Guess not. RAAAGH! C'MON, MAN! YOU TRYIN' TO HURT MY EARS?! OH, YEAH! But, I'm still not convinced. Okay, now I'm more convinced. Now, a lesser man might keep moving blindly, but I am a man of vision and I have seen more rockets. I mean, literally; I have some vacancies now and I haven't forgotten about those. Yuck. Now I can keep moving blindly. Speaking of blind, why did the soldiers both have their backs toward me when I came out of the hole even though the tank was facing my direction? I mean, it clearly looks like they're trying to guard this end of the road; the tank wouldn't be there otherwise. Maybe it's some interpretive form of guard duty hopscotch. This job probably gets pretty boring without me to come spice things up. WHOO-BA-DEE-BOOP-BOP-BOW! Well, it works both ways; they find plenty of ways to keep my day interesting as well. All right, let's do this. I hate playing peek-a-boo with this thing; there's no emotion. Totally cold. This AI is shit. This is why robots are never going to rule the world. Robots are only good at highly-specific tasks. We only wish they would take over the world. Then we wouldn't have to. But then, we're the ones that would have to program them, so what the hell? Is this a trap? Yeah, probably. This music really doesn't match my mood right now. Battery life on robots suck, too. LA LA LA LA LA! C'mon... Uhh... Why is this all green? FUCK! THIS IS RADIOACTIVE! ABORT! ABORT! WHY IS NOTHING HAPPENING?! SHIT! I KNEW THIS WAS A TRAP! THIS IS A RADIOACTIVE ROACH MOTEL... FOR PEOPLE! FUCKING SHIT! I'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE! I DON'T WANT TO DIE HERE SUCKING DOWN GAMMA RAYS! LOOK OUT! WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING MORONS DOING HERE?! GET OUT OF HERE! I'M NOT THE ENEMY! RADIATION'S THE INVISIBLE ENEMY! AND I'M LOST AND... SCARED, DAMMIT! YOU KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER ONE REGRET OF DYING PEOPLE IS? IT'S, "I REGRET PLAYING NEAR ALL THAT RADIOACTIVE WASTE "BECAUSE NOW I'M FUCKING DYING!" WHERE AM I?! So, are you guys fighting over me, is that it? Hey, now there's a thought. Damn, the bottom part's locked. What does this d-- I think I did something. Shit, I think they noticed me. I AM NOT REAL! Ah! NONE OF THIS IS REAL! Ah! THIS IS ALL YOUR HEAD! FOLLOW THE SOUND OF MY .50 CALIBER! OVER HERE! How is this gun NOT shooting through a tool cabinet? Does Snap-on have a special tankproof model or something? All right. Well, I'm satisfied. Through the power of hypnotic suggestion and a tank I was able to convince all these people they were dead. And, let's be honest. Whether they're real or not has no bearing on whether they SHOULD be real. Oh... FOLLOW THE HAPPY BALL! WHAT COULD IT BE?! LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK! NO! YOU DIDN'T-- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THE HAPPY BALL BUT YOU DIDN'T! NOW, NO ONE'S HAPPY! YEAH! THAT'S RIGHT! BET YOU WISHED YOU PICKED UP THE HAPPY BALL NOW, HUH?! Are you kidding me? Why is everybody standing here waiting for me? FUCK! That'll teach you to... cave in the ceiling. Mmmm... mmmm! Blue space lasers comin' in here actin' like they own the planet. AAAH! Give me a break! Okay, so, what do we know about you? You're blue. You're dangerous. Therefore... Waah...! See, this is why I'm such a good theoretical physicist. I solve problems that shouldn't even exist to begin with. I still don't get it. The aliens kept coming at me one by one around the corner. That makes no tactical sense at all. They should've either all come at once or all held back to ambush me. I mean, I'm glad they didn't, but, wow, they're not impressing me with their intelligence. In science fiction, the usual assumption is aliens are either just monsters or else way more advanced. There's not a whole lot on invading aliens that just are kind of stupid. Oh, is this another one of those giant lifts designed to move elephants underground or something? Yep, sure is. Okay, so where's the secret vent where the aliens pop out as soon as you start it? The last one was designed that way. May as well get a head start on it this time. Hey, what's that? Does this release the aliens? Oh, that's the door. I guess I should've realized that one. Actually, I don't even know why I'm even worried. They'll just send the aliens after me one by one. When I turned the corner, that one alien seemed surprised to see me. How could it not know I was there? I fired a tank! Okay, go-go-go-go-GO! Huh. Man, I hope I haven't screw my DNA because of that radiation. Oh. I remember watching a documentary on Chernobyl and it showed the camera crew going to the edge of the "safe zone". Then, on the drive back, their Geiger counter kept clicking like crazy and everybody had this "Oh shit!" look on their face because nobody factored in their car and gear ABSORBING the radiation. STOP DISTRACTING ME! AAAH! No! No! NO! WAAAH! BLAAAAGH! SLIMED! Yeah, I'm not understanding this invasion at all. I mean, it's obvious at least some of these teleportations are no accident. Then, why am I fighting alien wildlife? That would be like if we dropped in a bunch of stray dogs and badgers into a warzone. Sure it would--WAAH! ...it would cause SOME problems but nothing significant. Definitely not worth the energy to actually teleport something. It must take a lot. Now, maybe these aliens carry viruses they thought would spread--oh, nice-- but, if so, Black Mesa is the worst place to hit: low population, lots of lockdowns, in the middle of a desert. It's stupid. Maybe humanity is just MUCH better at invading than aliens are. We've had a lot of practice. Although, we've been acting pretty stupid ourselves--okay, what is this? Do I really want to go in this door? No. No, I don't. If I only had gotten that tank to move. I-I-I can't think about it; it just depresses me. Yeah... I'm about 95% sure this scientist didn't kill himself to paint the floor with his own blood as part of a performance art piece he was doing. Even Engineering wouldn't do something like that. The hell with it; if I turned around every time I saw a dead body and a huge blood trail... well, I'd probably be a lot safer right now but I wouldn't be any closer to getting out of here, so... Yeah, damn! I'm not a crime scene specialist but I think we can rule out nosebleed. Well, maybe, if he sneezed there... ...no. No. Well, I don't see any casings or bullet holes, so what was the cause of-- NINJAS! Dammit, of course! That's like rule number 1! It's Occam's Shuriken! When the answer is elusive, never rule out ninjas! Where are they? Shit. Where are they coming from? See? That one dropped in from nowhere; I should expect that! But, at the same time, I can't expect that because they're ninjas. As soon as I expect it, they won't do it. Ninjas understand quantum mechanics better than people realize. That was a controversial part of my dissertation. Shit, is that all of them? Truly, I'll never know. Science is no help here. You can never prove the absence of ninjas, only their direct presence. Oh, this must be how they're getting in here. Hell, if I can climb this, so can a... ...ninja. This also confirms what I saw yesterday was real because I thought I saw ninjas, but that was kind of fuzzy in my head, but here they are, without a doubt. I need to stop doubting my own sanity because I'm still right about EVERYTHING! Oh, my God, did I hit that one? Shit! DAMN, YOU'RE SPOOKY! Yeah, you can't double-back on ninjas. You have to triple-back. YAH! Woo-HYAH! I can't even really be sure if the ninjas I've shot are actually dead. They could just be faking it. They don't seem have much armor so they can't take the 12-gauge, but the 9 millimeter? I d-- AAAH! JESUS CHRIST! I can NOT be too careful! And I'm not! But, yeah, I remember reading about those Colombian drug lords buying designer clothes that were bulletproof against low-caliber shots. Eh, not this way. So, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if ninja suits had something similar woven into them. Y'know, I'm going to freak out if I come back and all the bodies are gone. Okay, that's one... Any more ninjas...? There's two. Now, I don't get it. They seem to be wearing night-vision goggles. If I was a ninja, like a legit one, I would start shooting out the lights. That would be a big advantage. But, I'm not going to tell them how to do their job. Death can be a learning experience. But, really, in all likelihood, this is how I'm going to die. Not today, I'm strapped and wired as shit right now, but hey, maybe a year from now-- ten years-- it's almost a certainty ninjas are going to track me down and try and kill me. It's a matter of honor now. Ha! And, really, it's no surprise, given my lifestyle. I'd hardly be the first. Who's the Italian one? Ettore Majorana. Brilliant theoretical physicist, friends with Heisenberg, wasn't much older than me before he was killed by ninjas. YOU'RE NOT A NINJA! STOP PRETENDING! OW! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! DAMMIT! YOU TRICKED ME INTO KILLING YOU IN A REALLY LOUD WAY! OH, WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT? YOU HAVE A HELMET! This is bullshit! We need to nuke this whole place as soon as I'm out. God dammit... Christ, I'm running light on bullets because every one of you bastards are built like... jacked-up space bouncers! I'm starting to think your species communicates only through a series of body lifts and squat thrusts. Oh, what the fuck is that?! SOMEBODY ELSE TRYING TO TAKE A SHOT AT ME?! HERE YOU GO! Aahh... damn... I kind of botched that. Stupid railing. Are they still there? Well, I woke them up at the very least. I should move in for a closer shot while they... meditate... or... I-I don't know what they're doing. AAAH! IT'S YOU! That won't work. Okay, okay, I won't kill you. What? No! Teleportat--? Yeah, story of my life. What the hell are you talking about Teleportation "Labs"? Do we have a room to study this already? Is this it? No... Okay, well, first off, that containment shit isn't going to work. They're teleporting. We need to leave! Hey, your thing's broken. Yeah, you take a look at it. But, seriously, how are you going to seal off monsters teleporting in from the air? You think if you deadbolt the door that'll do it. You're safe? And what was all that crap about a reactor and flooding it or something? Everyone here is talking like I've missed some sort of briefing. ...sure. Yeah, this blood's not coming off, is it? So, what did you say this was? A prototype leaf-blower? I don't know, man, this thing's pretty heavy, and I'm already carrying a load. I may not be able to haul this too far. Nice! Looks like plasma. Okay, I'll try it. Is this the ammo? Well, as long as it's sealed. So, uh, hey, what's this do? Oh, shit! I need to conserve ammo! I'M NOT DEALING WITH THIS! YOU HANDLE IT! YOUR LAB, YOUR RULES! BYE! Sometimes, I wonder... if I could've done things differently... Man, I don't get why that guy didn't just run out of the room. I guess he thinks he's bad ass enough to take on the aliens without the use of weapons. That seems kind of stupid to me. WHOA! Th... Okay, first thing's first. Did anything follow me? No? So, what the fuck is this? This is what "containment" looks like? Or, was he just carrying a grenade and... tripped? Yeah, I can hear them! THEY'RE ALREADY HERE! Wow! This thing works great! I don't know why the inventor didn't want it. What was that? Ah hah! Jesus...! Okay... So, I think what we can conclude here is blue energy is superior to green energy. And bees, but that was already one of our assumptions. Wuh-hoah! I could've fried you, but you're wearing blue so I guess that's a sign. Hey, you don't--yeah, I'm just going to take this. I mean, I don't see you trying to stop me and I need that ammo. Well, that's a complicated question. I think Black Mesa has evolved as a group consciousness so that no individual truly knows what he's doing. Like this guy. Recognize! What? No! No! I'm not the maintenance man! You have bad information! And what reactor? Is this it? The one with the big crack in it? We're not on the same page here. Look at me. Actually, hold up, I'll take this stuff off your hands for you. Okay, so you just stay here and keep staring at the wall. You're good at that. Biological force in the coolant system. Well, there's the problem. An alien must've teleported inside it. Even down a magazine, huh? Hey, I didn't notice that blood stain before, Mr. Target Range. Yeah, the splatter looks like it came from here. Holy shit! You shot somebody, didn't you?! I guess you're not a pushover; that's not alien blood! Yeah, I BET you don't me looking any further into this! But if you shot him, where's the body? Oh, there he is! So, you killed him. Those aliens were just feeding on him. Yeah, he's not even armed. Wow, I'm going to watch my back around here! I don't want any surprises from Captain Trigger Finger over there. I mean, the other people who shot at me, I mostly knew it was coming, but this... shit! Civilization's falling apart pretty fast! I mean, that's kind of scary, shooting the scientist. I'm a scientist. The guards aren't on our side, they're on their side! Oh god! This place is dangerous. And nobody knows what they're doing. There's probably going to be a Congressional hearing about us later asking, "How did this happen?" And every single person is going to say, "Uhhh... uhhh... uh..." Okay, did that guard shoot these guys, too?! Do they have any bullet holes in them? Actually, I don't want to know. Some people thrive in chaos a little too much. Everyone else sees disaster, he sees a human shooting gallery. Oh no! Yeah, what, you're going to cover up for him?! I dunno. I've killed people, too! But, the difference is I didn't kill them BECAUSE they were alive. I needed a reason...? Daah! Shhh... I really like how the-- whoa, what was that?! Somebody's up there! I am SO certain I am not hallucinating this time. And I have a gun! I can prove it! See? SHIT! I'm spent! Quit complaining about the reactor! I found the contaminant! Is he running from me? This one has brains! We can solve that problem. Shut up! I wonder if he was filming me. Well, I'm taking off this plasma pack. It's amazing but I need to fire it for MORE than 10 seconds total. Gragh... that's better. Yeah, it's a prototype. It only lasts for 10 seconds and weighs at least 50 pounds, but, MAN, it makes things explode. We could've sold it to the military without any further improvements. I especially I liked how the aliens I hit with it became totally stunned with this "Oh, my shit is getting wrecked" face. Okay, any surprises? No. Oh, dammit! I still think some of the aliens are teleporting inside the walls. Danger! Shit. OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OOOOOOOOOOH! That one almost went inside me! Aaaah... What?! Cross-dimensional pow--no, wait. What is this? Okay. "No access." I believe them! So... Oh, a switch. Maybe this will fix... everything. NO! IS THAT WHAT THIS SWITCH DOES?! Christ! Okay, one more, I'm shutting it off! I didn't know this was a monster generator, that's a terrible idea! Oh, this is just a pump. I guess this is all just a terrifying coincidence. Jesus, I'm getting low on bullets. I have one spare mag then I'm out. The scientists probably don't keep any spares on them. Dimensional contamination. There we go again. Whoever set up this intercom system clearly wanted to fight me. I keep hearing "dimensional power", "dimensional contamination", what the fuck are they talking about?! I'm pretty sure these aliens are three-dimensional! Probably from somewhere deep in space, but space isn't another dimension! Does somebody here think they're Buckaroo Banzai?! But, okay, let's say that teleportation event represents cross-dimensional activity. How do we know this? Have we figured all this out in the past two days during a panic? And, invented and set up cross-dimensional detectors around the facility like they're smoke alarms AND set up a network-to-intercom system to inform us when one happens? If so, WOW! Color me impressed! That's pretty good considering your reactor is down and you have a rogue security guard dancing through the halls and shooting your science team. I wouldn't be able to get work done under those conditions. Silly me, I thought it was turning into Lord of the Flies around here. Okay, I've already been here... Yeah, I guess this way. But, yeah, these announcements aren't fooling me. We're on the brink. I bet if I wait a few hours and then come back, that security guard will be wearing a necklace made out of ears and painting pictures of demons or some crap on the walls with the scientists' blood. And then he's going to take-- Well... Shit... Y'know, all this concrete dust is a breathing hazard. Nnngrrrragh! "Danger"! "Radioactive materials". Oh, Jesus, that just gave me a horrible thought. No... no! We can't be THAT stupid! Please! No! Oh, this isn't so bad. This column is clearly waiting for me to pass THEN it will collapse so I can die of thirst or starvation. Maybe I already am and don't even know it yet. NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEED ME BEES; IT'S NOT THAT BAD! Okay, can your alien intellect figure out how doors work? Oh, they're thinking about it. Maybe it's too hard for them... since it's motion-sensored? Yeah, they couldn't figure it out. Well, good job trying to ambush me. Almost. Hey, I'm getting low on shells so you know what that means. Hey, I don't like this any more than you do. Rockets for tanks and attack choppers are no-brainers. Frankly, it's a bit much for you, but what am I supposed to do? I'm low on ammo and you're running across the room. Huh, guess I won't die of thirst. But yeah, what am I supposed to do, go hand-to-hand with the bodybuilder aliens? Yeah, that'd be smart, wouldn't it? I suppose that'd be the "honorable" thing to do, but "honor" doesn't really apply to me. I mean, look at the-- OH MY GOD! Well, thanks for testing the tensile strength of the catwalk, but your services are no longer required. Yeah, just ignore gunfire. That works for me. Wow! All right, so I guess the aliens have lowered their standards for shock troopers. I mean, that alien was obviously high. He falls off a ledge. He doesn't care, he's high. I shoot him in the head. He doesn't care, he's high. He's a galactic stoner. But yeah, while the resource allocation DOES concern me, I'm not going to lose sleep over bringing a rocket launcher to a bee fight. Umm... Okay, maybe this does something. Yeah... the thing is, fighting honorably and winning are incompatible goals. In World War II, the Japanese TRIED to do it honorably but even they knew it wasn't going to work. Like, when they hit Pearl Harbor. The idea... ...come on... The idea was attacking the USA unaware would be dishonorable, so they tried warning us half an hour before it happened, but their military delayed that message until 20 minutes AFTER it happened. Fuck! So, I guess they kept their honor on a technicality? Like the ball was on the goal line and there were three seconds left on the clock, therefore the Pearl Harbor attack was honorable or something? Yeah, what the hell am I talking about? This is my last pistol magazine. Of course I used the right weapon! More guns, less madness. Okay, what's the story on this guy? Did he blow his brains out? I hope he left some bullets behind. But, it's hard to say; knowing our staff, he probably missed a few times trying to aim for his head. No, I don't see anything. Okay, another pump. I was trying not to think about this. I don't exactly know what this switch does, but I need to pull it right now, because if I'm wrong, I made some parts move around and some lights flash, doesn't matter. But, if I'm right about this... Oh my God! Being right about everything is a curse! Let's look at the evidence: we have a staff member getting snippy with me about a reactor; we have that intercom talking about biological contaminants; we have those red pump warning lights; and we have the building literally falling apart. I think we have a nuclear reactor down here, an alien teleported inside it, now it's broken, and is going to meltdown unless I flood it with coolant. I mean, somebody tell me I'm wrong, that a team of top researchers are not so tragically obtuse that we pass off a fucking China syndrome as just "one of those things"! The scientist trying to give me orders was slightly annoyed. He wasn't somber or panicked at all. Yeah, a meltdown IS really annoying. I get it! I think I'm the only person here who understands how serious this is. I hope I'm wrong, but this is all too plausible. Even though we have a dam, we use as much power as a city. I can believe we have a nuclear reactor here also. Plus, these are my colleagues who thought sealing off the entrance would contain random teleportations. They drew straws to decide who would let me in. Now that I am in, I'm sure the prevailing theory being discussed behind my back is that all these aliens just showed up during the two minutes they left the door open and I walked in. This is my fault. Of course. I know what's happening here. I've seen this a hundred times. This reeks of groupthink. You have one normally brilliant person make a stupid decision and everyone else just falls in line, doesn't question anything. These people aren't scientists; they're cultists with advanced degrees. I guess I'll go talk to the reactor guy, find out just how long we have to live. SHOW ME YOUR HANDS OR I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF! Yeah, try me, psycho-breath! What's THAT supposed to mean?! NO, DON'T ANSWER THAT! I'M NOT LETTING YOU GET INSIDE MY MIND! Fucking psycho Kurtz serial-killing security guard... Hey, we need to talk! You've turned on the pumps! labs without delay! Oh, so NOW you're talking like there's some urgency. The ramifications are starting to sink in, huh? Well, I saved your ass. And everyone else's. If you clowns had just said the word "meltdown", we could've saved a lot of time. Your communication skills are horrible. I swear, I'm the only person in this building who's not an idiot savant. "Dimensional"... WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS, POP TART?! IT'S ME POINTING A 12-GAUGE AT YOUR FACE! You may think you're hard because you plugged a scared old man, but try that number on me and watch what happens! I didn't come all this way just to get shot in the back of the head by some bored rent-a-cop. If the ninjas took me out, there would at least be some dignity to that. With you, there's nothing. Absolutely nothing. Okay, is this the reactor? IS YOUR NAME "REACTOR"?! HEY, THIS IS A MISUNDERSTANDING! JESUS! I'M NOT EVEN SURE I HAVE THE RIGHT ROOM! AAAH! DAMMIT, I'M OUT! HI! HOW ARE YOU NOT-- Good God! I didn't realize the aliens made this their bathhouse! AAAAH! WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU WEREN'T THERE AND NOW YOU'RE REAL! THIS IS INNSBRUCK ALL OVER AGAIN! GO! BACK! TO NOTHING! THAT'S WHERE YOU BELONG! Okay, I'm going to stay in my corner. Then, to sneak up on me, you have to teleport into a wall, so fuck you! You know what the difference is between my hallucinations and other people's? My hallucinations shoot back at me and kill other people. You know, maybe I SHOULD keep moving, because they probably WILL teleport behind me, then collapse the building. Then, they win because they're aliens, so who cares, and I'm dead. So, is this the reactor room or what? It looks pretty flooded to me. Jeez, that's a lot of blood on the wall. I don't think the aliens did that. The splatter velocity's too high. Oh, there's an entrance there. Shit, that's kind of deep. I guess this suit lets me sink down pretty fast. I don't know. The stakes are pretty high, but--Oh, my God! How did I not see this? Am I blind?! This kit might have morphine! Yes, here it is! Morphine sulfate! Aahhh... Yeah, I'll start feeling this soon. Oh, my God, did I need this! This is fucking perfect. Alright, let's get the blood flowing so this kicks in! A cold swim should do just the trick. Time to go save the world! I don't think I'm feeling it, yet. Maybe... I don't know. "Radiation". Well, I'm either getting a little bit or a lifetime supply. Well, this COULD be the reactor. Honestly, we own so much huge machinery, I have no idea. Okay, that's partially flooded. Soon, I'll get back to long-term panic instead of all this short-term panic. It's flooded! I'm a hero! What the hell? Man, fuck you! I just saved your life from a meltdown, I'm a hero! You can't zap me like that, I'm a hero! Yeah! Jesus. Electricity does not respect my heroism. Well, I guess climbing out of here is a good idea, right? Right. I don't get it. Why is there so much arcing-BLAAAAH! AAAH! AAAH-AAAAH-AAAAAH! Huh, maybe being on a metal ladder isn't so smart, either, especially since I'm still wet? Uhh... Okay, I didn't feel much. I guess my boots have some insulation in them. Or maybe it's the morphine. Hmmm. Alright, time to go jump the-- Shit, I think I made a mistake. I don't think I flooded the reactor; I THINK THIS IS THE GENERATOR, GOD DAMMIT! WHY WOULD THEY FLOOD THAT?! THAT WOULD JUST BE DANGEROUS AND BREAK THINGS! GRRAAAAAAAAAAGH! GOTTA GET OUT OF TORTURE CHAMBER! I DON'T NEED ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY! I ALREADY HAVE MY--YAAAAAH! Fucking shit! I'm getting out of here before it melts through the door. I'm feeling pretty good, though. I haven't felt this good since... yesterday when I got to the surface and thought I was going to leave. Except then the military started bombing the place, then I felt... bad. Hey, "Supplies", I like supplies. Okay, not the radioactivity. I have enough of that. Thank you. No. Hey, this looks civilized. Where does this go? Up. Okay, where's the button? Oh, there is no button. It must be on the outside. We design a lot of elevators like that. Oh, I see. The button doesn't work. We design a lot like that, too. Okay, I can climb. An old-fashioned elevator. The kind that's powered by... ladders. What was that? Well, where's the...? Oh, come on, guys. You can design this better. All right, I'm... Batman. Yeah-ha-ha-ha! Yeah, this is great. "SUPPLIES"! I like supplies. Let's get some supplies. Oh, wow, more drugs. I-I don't know. I'm feeling pretty good now. Okay, I'll take this. That's... yeah. I don't know. I might overdose. What do you think, Mr. Crate? Yeah, you always know what to say. I'd better play it safe. Oh, wow. What the fuck are you? You're blue. That's a tragedy, really. You look like all the others. I should go and fix that for you. Stop mumbling. Oh, wow. You know my name. That's amazing. Well, you SHOULD! I'm a hero! Ooooh! You're right. Why fight temptation? Yeah, I can handle some more... I'm a hero! Fuck, yeah! I am ready to face everything! I'm feeling a little drowsy, but that's cool. I'm very chill. What's this? Okay... I think I just watched some guy kill himself by walking into the portable sun. I didn't know we had one of those. Or that they even existed. Whoooaaaaaah... Wake up time! Hah! I didn't even feel that! Hey, how are you doing? I feel great! Hey, I've gotta ask you something... What do you know about nuclear fusion? Nothing, right? Yeah, I didn't think so. Oh! Now, YOU...! I know YOU don't know anything. Hey, listen, these monsters are interrupting my train of thought. So, you need to talk to the administrator and tell him to stop it, all right? Just stop it. We've got enough monsters for at least nine weeks. This is total overkill. I was meant to turn this... That did... something. "Radiation Hazard"--they're bluffing... Raaaah... I wanted to see the portable sun. How did we do that? That's fusion power! And we have it here all tucked--Whoooooah... Oh, shit... no. I don't think I trust this, yet. It glows. Buttons! No... Jesus Christ! What am I looking at? Is this a star? Did we create a fucking star in a box somehow? I didn't feel any heat off it. Did we figure out cold fusion? Cold fusion has been the butt of physics jokes forever; it's an embarrassment. Isn't that in the Journal of Irreproducible Results? But, you know what? I bet those guys didn't have spinning energy balls just hovering and... trying to read my mind. Why am I seeing more of these down here? This is obviously just a storage area. Maybe I took too much morphine... But, fuck that! I can walk and everything. And I feel so good! Buttons! Zooba-dabba-dooba-dabba-dabba-da! It's cold fusion; how come I'm not in this department? There must be an explanation. This is my explanation?! I don't understand! This is too interpretive. I don't have to take this, I'm a hero! Hey, are you an oracle? No, you don't look like one. Hey, this is just like Dirty Harry. A long-range scene. No, wait. It was one of the sequels. That's my favorite Dirty Harry movie. The one where he guns down the giant monster with the tentacle arms. "Make my day, squidface." Ehh, you're not as big as the one in the movie. I feel like skipping through the hallway. It's a nice big one. Oh, what's in here? Awww. Maybe I won't skip. It's kind of heavy with the suit and the guns... ...and the bang... ...and more bang... ...bang-bang... ...and kaboom... ...and... oh boy... Blaaaaghaaghgagh! Bugs... Man, you guys made this hallway all dirty. Why did you do that? It was nice and squeaky clean before you showed up. It made me want to roll around in it. I don't want to do that anymore. Well, this is a little better. Where my lab at? Bahh! Ah, okay, I think I figured out what this place is. This is where we take all the VIPs looking to fund the place. There are labs but they're all a little too clean. Oh, shit, not this one. What the hell happened here? That splatter mark looks like this guy fell two stories. How does somebody trip like that? And we're leaking radiation; this is not part of the tour. But, yeah, we take the VIPs here, show them the energy balls, they don't know anything so they're impressed and give us more money, when the reality is they're holograms. I'm sure of it. Yeah, see, look at that pad underneath; these are holograms! Wow. A lot of them. Those rotating platforms are cool, too. Yeah, this would impress the hell out of me if I didn't know anything. In fact, it STILL impresses me, because I'm kind of high? Yee-hahahaha... Oh, wow, this looks dangerous. Yeah, there's a certain percentage of the public that believes, unless you have robots or glowing lights, that science isn't happening. But, we have BOTH. That's why we're so well-funded. Some people expect chemistry sets and dry ice fog, but I think we have some rooms for that, too. Okay, I'm going to test my theory like a TRUE scientist on drugs. Da-DAH! I didn't feel anything. At all. Okay, I'm going to walk... Yeah, it's totally a hologram! Heeehhhh... Well, I could stare at these a long time, the way I'm feeling right now but I still don't know where --where I'm supposed to be going... whoa... wait. Something happened. Okay, I guess I came in through this door...? Why did I lock this? Shit... Did I black out again? Why am I standing? Memory... So, what do I remember? I remember-- Waah! I remember gas filling the room, ghost... wizards... Ooooooh! Oh, wow! That... that would've hurt. Uh oh. Hold it right there! A ventriloquist! I pity the fool! No... Whoa-whoa. Who are you? I'm Gordon! I can do both your jobs. You people talk like you know what you're doing, but you don't. Oh, "Loading Bay", that's good! What? What are you aiming at? Man, you two are higher than I am! You're all just fronting. I've seen too much of that. Yeah, keep us safe from the empty elevator, Scooby. I'm leaving. That guy said they're going down to safety. Going down isn't safe. Going UP isn't safe. Those two are probably dead by now. Getting away from here could be MORE safe. I think the President has pretty good security. Hey, maybe I could disguise myself-- no, wait, that wouldn't work. I would need a professional makeup artist. Eddie can't do makeup for shit. Well, I would've preferred another snack machine, but, y'know, sugar's the same as food, right? Hey, wait! I don't have to pay for this! In Black Mesa, I am king of the vending machines. Yeah! Yeah ha ha! Oh... Ow! Shit... Okay... Whoa... JESUS! This is bad soda! I'm not drinking that! Let me out of here, Captain... Woody of the... Box... Brigade... I've seen you before. I can't decide if I'd rather have food or more bullets. I'm not eating this thing; I know that much. Hey! This is an illegal gathering of three or more freaks. got this old sidearm on me, aren't ya? You didn't fired a single shot. Are you being serious, sir? Yeah, my hero. Bet you don't have one of these, huh? Does this bug you? You didn't even blink. Jesus... What are you? Never mind, just don't make me kill us both, okay? I hate when that happens. Oh, here we go. Some magazines. This will buy me at least five more minutes of life. I wonder if insurance rates for Black Mesa survivors go up. Like, adjustors would say if you're in one alien invasion, that means you're at risk for another. Ah, who am I kidding? There's not going to be any survivors. Like, even with the military, I don't see that happening. Oh, wow, you're no fun. I'll show you the... meaning of... fun... Yeah. Are we having fun yet? Sure looks like it. Huh, the Laser Tag Extreme Fun Zone. Oh, you think I don't see you? That will enhance the fun. Well, everybody likes surprises. Quick, painless surprises. Surprise! What the--? You must have got a dud; I'm sorry. Let's try again. Hooray! Sorry for ruining the surprise. I know it's never as good trying to do it again, but I think we can agree that the results are what I wanted. I think surprises where people end up dead are always the biggest ones. Oh, man, aren't these guys done already? Man... You guys shooting me isn't helping my aim any. There we go. Thanks! Hello? Ah! Yes! That's good! Yes, run towards my gunshots! That helps me out a lot. You have no idea. So, did I miss anyone? Raise your hand if I didn't-- Okay, well, I can't tell if you're just a voice in my head, so you don't count. So, yeah, I don't see the soldiers surviving this, even without me. Like, the theory is that this is a cover up, which I still think makes no sense. It's too big. That's like trying to cover up the President being assassinated. "Oh, yeah, the President's fine. "He totally did not get his head blown apart on national television." But fine. We're going to 'cover this up', but the thing is-- Ooh. Oh, sweet. This is a great idea. I can see why they built it this way. I'm not doing anything the warehouse workers haven't done a hundred times already. Aww. Hey, stop it, Cargo Commando! I hear something. Oh! They just bombed their own troops again! This is exactly what I'm talking about! Hey, they're bombing! I'm outside! I didn't even notice! Jesus, how is it night already?! Well, that's it. I blacked out. There's no other explanation. This is what happens when I play pharmacist. Although... I still feel pretty great! "Squad, quiet down." "Negative." All right, works for me. I'm happy to know where everyone is. You are there... Aaah. Ah, and I am here. I think that's about the best communication I'm going to have with the military. They can't even spell my name right. But, it's alright. Again, no one is going to leave here alive. Especially not the soldiers. Nyah! Are these secret documents? What was I doing? I don't remember. But yeah, the thing about the soldiers is that, if this is a cover up, the government already doesn't trust its top secret researchers in the country, so why is it going to trust its special forces? See, look at that. I bet they didn't even identify me. I bet I could disguise myself in one of their uniforms and it wouldn't make a damned bit of difference. There has been a LOT of friendly fire around here. Okay, that's it. If you can't behave yourself, you can have time out, mister. What was that? Okay, let's keep it that way. So, besides these soldiers tripping over themselves to kill each other before I do, they may have bigger problems. Because, if they're doing the cover up job, somebody else is going to cover up the cover up job. Okay, I like what I'm seeing here. I'M OVER HERE! YOO-HOO! Perfect. I love these guys that run towards me! They are a dying breed. Eh, I think that's the last of them. Come and check out the noise! Hup! Was that guy waving at me? "Yeah, head to the left, I saw him over there!" Okay, THAT'S the last of them. Ohhhh! You're pulling THAT shit on me? Umm... I am so confused. Did that guy run into his own grenade? Or did somebody in the shadows throw one at him? Or, was he just charging me, suicide-bomber style, and get his timing wrong? Is that how we train them? As suicide-bombers? So many questions. Man, something's definitely off with this cover up operation. Yeah, nobody's here. With THIS much friendly fire, I don't think it's an accident. What the hell?! Yeah, I'm still here! Yep, they just blew up another guy with their own grenade. I should turn this light off. I wish I had a walkie-talkie so I could just throw that down and transmit my voice so they would all open fire blindly and shoot each other. I mean, we're halfway there already. They're not what I would call discriminate. Yep. Yep. All these bodies and gunshots are trying to ruin my mood. But it's going to take more than that! I have the power of chemistry on my side. Anyway, what the fuck did I just see? It's like the soldiers were waiting until I showed up, then executed the scientist in front of me. I mean, why bother? I don't know these people. I know this was directed at me because there's no way they didn't hear all the gunshots and explosions prior to this. This smells better than I thought, but still bad. Okay, I'm coming up with three possible options for what's going on here with the military. Now, the first option... Um... What was I thinking about? Waah! Maybe this is a bad time for me to spacing out. Is this a closet? Hello? Can you let me in? I tried blowing up your door but it didn't work. Who said that?! Where are you? Oh, that must be the ghost. He sounds different than I imagined. Hey, it's neon green. Do they throw raves in here? The acoustics would suck. Oh, it's radioactive. Well, at least it's "click click" and not "clickyclickclickclick". You can still cut that shit out, though. Oh, that's what I was thinking about. So, option one is this is the cover up and the troops are being covered up, too. Like one out of every five troops is secretly a merc and his job is to kill the other troops. Then they'll bomb the place to kill the mercs, then they'll kill the bomber pilot, and then write this all up as a... plane accident. Why not? Whoa! Okay, ghost. I guess you know what's best. So option two is, everybody's on drugs. Combat time is drug time! Shoot anybody you want. It's cool. He's high, too. Get high before you die! That's my favorite theory. No, wait! I don't want to die yet! FUCK! Down you go! YEAH, KISS THE FLOOR, ASSHOLE! That's good! Carry on! Shit, I don't think I can trust the ghost anymore. I hope he stops talking to me. I wasn't really prepared for that. A bunch of people bursting in trying to kill me, that's something I've always been preparing for. Mentally, anyway. But a ghost mildly harassing me and giving me bad advice is just whole other kind of hell. Especially here. I don't need another hell inside my existing hell. Hell squared is still hell. What the hell is this? All right, they're either sealing me in or they're breaching. Somebody thinks they're big and bad because they're a welder, but I'm not going to take their shit either way. BACK AT YOU! Okay, I think that slowed them down. Yeah, you'll think twice before doing that again. Especially since you're a skull. So, how do I lift up this giant concrete slab? Is there like a switch? I'm not feeling one. Uhh... I can't fit through this hole. Stupid ghost... Yeah, I can't lift this. We should've designed this suit to have pneumatic jacks built into the arms. Can I climb out of here? No, it doesn't reach the ceiling. Maybe I should stop this gas filling the room, huh? I'm glad they have a valve here to stop it; this must happen often. Oh, this is new. Yeah, this was sealed; there was no hatch. Why would we build a ladder going up to a grate you can't open? Is this a dungeon? Yeah, maybe. Like, the ladder is just to tease the prisoners to thinking they can see the sky through the grate, except it's a trick because they're still inside a dome. Yeah, don't touch me. Well, this IS a dungeon. What? Oh, I'm sorry! Were you using that ammo?! Could've fooled me! So, those are literally your last words? Screaming at somebody not to touch your stuff. Boy, you lived a fulfilling life, huh? Okay... that's definitely more than one ghost. What am I looking at? No! Hey, you're a witness! Fuck, this even MORE radioactive. This is exactly the kind of clicking I don't want to be hearing. I don't like performing Dance of the Geiger Counter. Hey, uhh... Oh, okay, you're busy. That's good. Oh, here we go! Oh, wow! Perfect! I could use some popcorn for this! Might want to fire your gun there... No? Okay, that's just me. This guy is giving a performance! I respect that. I should get a good grip in case his body hits me on the way down. Ah hah! Someone's spying on me! I knew it! Or maybe he's motioning for me to follow him but I'm not going to. Hey, what the hell? It was just a zombie making him move around like it's a giant puppet show. I don't like the implications of this. All they've been doing so far is running into walls and acting angry at the world, and now they're playing Punch and Judy with the bodies. The other was dragging it around like it was a teddy bear. I don't know if it's a sign of growing intelligence or something else. Well, you don't disappoint! You don't change a bit! I can always count on you to be horrible. Simple and horrible. Excuse me? I... thought I heard someone. Someone green. Or, maybe I really have caught a bullet in the head and I'm hearing colors now. I don't think synesthesia's contagious but the sky's the limit when you've got head trauma. Anyway, if the zombies are getting smarter, I think the next logical step is for them to steal the soldiers' uniforms and pretend to be one of them. They would get shot, but the soldiers shoot each other anyway. I estimate the zombies would have about a 50% success rate at infiltrating us if they tried that. The soldiers would look at them and think they're sick or... well, I don't know WHAT goes through their heads. Ehh... No, you go first! It's cool. I can wait. This is NOT a line I'm in a rush to get through. It just really doesn't pay to be in front here. If I thought I could pull it off, I would put the zombie in MY suit and just march him out here. The military would kill him then say, "Yep, we got Freeman. Our job's done here." I'm pretty sure they would buy it. I mean, look at-- Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Option 3: the most likely option. Yah! People keep interrupting me! But, yeah, Option 3 is the military is rock stupid. Like frightening stupid. Like crash-planes-into-buildings-bomb-your- own-troops-and-shoot-half-your-squad stupid. "Duh... whoops! I killed the wrong guy again!" Like maybe the only soldiers that aren't literally retarded either have non-combative duty or else they're overseas. So, what I'm seeing is all that's left. This isn't THAT hard. I mean, c'mon, these are walking green Tasers. I don't think I want to wait on THIS crowd. See, this is what I mean. That guy was just walking casually in the center of the room, exposed. Did he have headphones on? Have music playing so loud you can't hear gunshots? They might sell earbuds like that. I'm not sure. Must've been pretty good music since I'm assuming he had his eyes closed since there were green bolts of electricity flying around. Or maybe that just happened to fit the beat so that he didn't give it much conscious thought until it was too late. Music soothes even the... spaced-out Marine who forgot he was in the middle of a warzone, apparently. Shit, if I could document this, I could publish this as a research paper on the way out the door! Because, that's how I roll. I lose my job, I have a research paper before I'm out the building! No, wait, shit. I'm a fugitive and I killed a lot of people. I forgot. So, I guess that guard broke the door because he was bored. Where do I go now? C'mon! There has to be a ventilation shaft here somewhere. What's this? Is this a security station? No, this is for mixing music. Maybe the guard's a DJ on the side. There HAS to be a shaft. We have great airflow here. In all my time at Black Mesa I've never seen anyone suffocate in their office or black out because of carbon dioxide poisoning. That hasn't been true at all jobs I've worked at. Oh, you broke it good, huh? How did--WAHH! Oh, so you HERDED them there! You really ARE a space rancher! That's awesome! Well, I hate to do this to you, but I have to put them down. I need you to step over here. Yeah, c'mon waggle-jaw. I'll be humane about this... not that I care about that, but I do care about quick so our goals are the same. Oh, what the hell? How did I miss that? Okay, that wasn't supposed to happen and now I've spooked the animals, so let's just do this the traditional way. Our colleague down in the dungeon would've wanted this. Or, maybe he just wanted to be buried with his shotgun shells, but what do we care? He's dead. Now, does this work? Yep! Here we go! Are you watching this? Oh, yeah! Ho! Whoa! Christ... I got a little carried away there. I'm glad nothing ricocheted at me. And now the job gets more complicated. See, it was better when you were all packed together. I mean, c'mon, safety in numbers, right? Exactly. Eh, I spoke too soon. Now, are there any more of you here? Drinking some soda? No? Well, I have to say I'm impressed. That guy herded six of them into this hallway. That takes talent. I wasn't the only one thinking outside the box. Y'know, one of my regrets about leaving here is I didn't get to do all the experiments I wanted. Like I wanted to slip Rohypnol into the coffee pot for a few weeks and observe how that affected people's work habits. Waah! Oh. You're not real. Ha ha. Man, you two aren't dead yet? Oh, right, I just saved you. You're welcome. You can pay me, y'know. I take cash. Oh, funny man! You're saying that to me! Well, you ARE cowering in my presence appropriately so I guess I can't be too hard on you. Okay, you get to live. But I'm going to need you to stand there and smack yourself in the head repeatedly, alright? Who's he talking to? There's no one here. Uh, no. This is the absolute worst it can get. I can't imagine anything worse than what you've seen. Oh, my God. You people are all hopeless. You say that like a bored kid wanting to know what time lunch is. I can't help you. You shouldn't have even made it this far in life. You lack basic problem-solving skills. That's so fundamental. You need to be in a home. Okay, good. This doesn't even have a code so I don't need you. You're going to die here. I'm sorry. There's no way Shit, something's happening. I think I'm having flashbacks. Oh, God.... Okay, I'll try to get it off. Shit, did I hit him? I don't want to think about this. Yeah, you're next, you hopping maggot! WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WANT YOUR ADVICE?! Shit... everyone's trying to tell me what to do; ghost, aliens, people, they're never going to stop until they're all dead. Except the ghost. OHHH! MOTHERFUCKER! YOU'RE IN ON IT, TOO! AND YOU! They ambushed me! They ARE getting more intelligent! That was an honest-to-God trap! I think the hopper was just bait! He lured me in there! Well, that's one problem solved. Guess I hit him after all. Oh, come ON! Shit, maybe he ran in there. Well, will the guard help me after what I said? He may be too stupid to be offended, but he may not even know the code. Screw it. I don't want the drama. I'll take the shaft that looks like an exposed ribcage. If I have to wrestle with the maggot thing in here, I'm pretty sure I'm going to remember that the rest of my life. I mean, I'm going to remember a lot of this, but some things cut deeper than others. Oh... wide load coming through... everybody back up. Uh... Oh, shit. Looks like the bridge clearance was too low. Maybe he'll smash a way out of here and I can just follow in his wake. And we have locked blast doors here, too, because, apparently we anticipated this sort of thing. I mean, the ceiling was built high enough for him. You could perform a full trapeze act in this room. Well, this is pretty convenient, really. Yeah, why not? I'll give this a try as soon as the electricity dies down some. Then I won't be stunned before dropping down twenty feet. Chuggachuggachuggachuggachuggachuggachugga chuggachuggachuggachuggachuggachugga! Ah, that's better. But now we have an air vent dragon. Wait, no, too loud. FUCK YOU! I HATE YOU AND I'M GONNA GO KILL YOUR WHOLE FAMILY NOW! Y'know, the joke's gonna be on me if I find out later that these things actually taste good when cooked and we're raising them in a few years, but I just don't see that--WAAAH! Oh, lucky... I should do something...! I'm kind of freezing up here! What am I doing?! This is good, I think! No, this isn't working! Let's do it some more! C'mon! God! Get out of there, moron! Oh, fuuuck! THIS IS BULLSHIT! EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN DOING UP UNTIL THIS POINT WAS SO I WOULD NOT BE IN THIS EXACT SITUATION! BUT NONE OF IT MATTERS BECAUSE GIANT ALIENS ARE DETERMINED TO FUCK ME ANY WAY THEY CAN! WAAAAAAAAAH! OH, THAT'S IT! NOW, I'M DEAD! I AM DEAD NOW! NOBODY'S GONNA KNOW HOW AWESOME I AM! WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUCK! WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT HAPPENED?! HOW DID YOU TURN INTO THREE PEOPLE?! WHAT-- GET *WHAT* UNDER CONTROL?! ME?! I WANT ANSWERS, ASSHOLE! IS THIS A THOUGHT-EXPERIMENT?! AM I IN A SIMULATION RIGHT NOW?! IS THIS DRUG-INDUCED LUCID DREAMING?! I KNOW I'M NOT DEAD! IT LOOKS LIKE WITCHCRAFT TO ME! THIS IS A CABAL! YOU SUMMONED ME HERE AS PRACTICE FOR A DEMON, RIGHT?! SAY SOMETHING! WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU THINK THIS IS A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT?! YOU THINK I'M JUST A TEST SUBJECT?! WELL, I KILLED YOUR LEADER! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?! YOU'RE DEALING IN FORCES YOU'RE NOT PREPARED FOR! WHAT DO YOU THINK A DEMON WOULD'VE DONE TO YOU?! SHARE HIS LAB NOTES?! Stupid... well-- DON'T LOOK AT ME! Okay... Demon-summoning idiots... I didn't even mean to shoot that guy, but they literally forced my hand. They shouldn't be surprised. You mess with the Freeman, this is what happens. Okay, locked, uh... Well, what's this? More black magic, no doubt. Okay, I'm just going to touch this quick. WHOA! SHIT! NO! THOSE BASTARDS DID IT AGAIN! I'M GONNA KILL THEM! Wait, no! I've been here before! Yeah, this makes no sense! I touched this thing--it's harmless! Right? Yeah, nothing. So, what's going on here? This is the same thing, right? Or are they different? Well, here, I already-- OOOOH! SHIT! IT'S A TELEPORTER! WE INVENTED FUCKING TELEPORTERS! THE NEW AGE OF MAN BEGINS WITH ME! AND TELEPORTERS! Oh, my God! I am dizzy from this! Or maybe that's because I'm spinning. I've gotta try it again. Does this work? It's orange. Ohhh-ho-ho-ho! So, this is what it's like to be a ninja. Amazing! Wonder what the power source is... or why they hover. Yeah, I have a lot of questions. Nice! Dah! Like, is this Star Trek-style where it's transmitting my matter as energy and reconstructing it on the other end? Or is it just creating an exact duplicate of me and I'm really just committing suicide over and over? Hmm. Hoo... No, I don't feel dead, but am I me or am I Gordon #6? I might not know the difference. Well, I should continue either way, even if that means making sacrifices for the Greater Gordon. I mean, I can't think of a cause I believe in more than that. Let's go! WhoooaaAAAAAAAAAAAAA! My knees hate me... Why would they put the exit point there? Especially when there are rotating platforms? WHY ARE THERE ROTATING PLATFORMS?! IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE NEEDED FOR THE TELEPORTER BALLS! THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE! YEAH, WHAT THE FUCK?! LOOK AT THIS PLACE! ALL THAT'S MISSING ARE THE BOBBING HORSE RIDES AND CALLIOPE MUSIC! THERE'S NO GOD DAMNED REASON FOR THIS! WE'VE INVENTED TELEPORTERS! THAT'S "FUCK YOU, PAY ME!" RESEARCH! WE DON'T NEED TO PAD OUR COSTS WITH HIGH-TECH CAROUSELS! Oh, I get it. It's to double the experiments, so if the teleportation doesn't make you vomit then the platforms will. Fuck. No, not that one again! Don't drop me! Good. Hey, how does the teleporter know to teleport just me? I didn't feel any air moving with me. Maybe it detects-- Oh, joy! More radiation leaks! This is a great place for a teleporter junction. Ah! Fuck! Where is it?! Y'know what? You can die down there slowly by radiation poisoning. That works just fine for me. I'm happy to conserve my ammo. Of course... All right... Let's do this. Oh. All roads lead to Rome, huh? Seriously, why do we have so many radioactive waste problems? Like, we can't find a better place to put it out here in the middle of the desert? Okay, THIS time, let's do it right. Whoa, shit... Yeah, that's a great start... Okay, now here's to hoping it doesn't teleport me to just a random green ball. Okay... Yeah, this is a great place to put that pipe, too. Maybe I'm expected to lay flat, spread-eagle, because that makes as much sense as anything here. Oh, these are numbered. I didn't notice. Oh, you again! Okay, time for dance lessons. Yeah, one-two... ah, you losers can't dance. I don't know why I expected otherwise. Oh, there's an escape route. Excellent. Is this a bunker full of provisions? I'll take canned food, dried... anything. Hey, wait. I've been here before. This is the other side of that supply room. Yeah, this is another one of those rooms with "creative architecture" that was designed for giant spiderpeople, because that's the only kind of person who would find this layout convenient. SHUT THE FUCK UP! YOU THINK WE'RE COOL NOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T KILLED YOU, YET?! YOU HAD TELEPORTERS AND WERE HOLDING OUT ON ME! I'M NOT GONNA FORGET THAT! EVER! Hey, that's an excellent point: if we already HAD teleporters, why the hell was my team even doing the experiment?! THERE'S NO POINT TO THE EXPERIMENT IF TELEPORTERS ALREADY EXIST! BLAAA- --AAAGH! THAT'S LIKE TESTING FOR TESTING FOR WATER WHEN IT'S R-- --AINING! So, what happened? Did they make this off OUR research or were we duplicating work for no reason at all?! I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL THE SAME COMPANY! WHY ARE DIVISIONS BACKSTABBING?! ARE WE MICROSOFT?! I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT I WORKED AT BLACK MESA! Whoa-ho-OH! WAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAA-- --AH! OH, GOD! Ah, jeez... Well... It looks like momentum from teleportation is not preserved. That's helpful, but that raises so many more questions. Like-- --wouldn't my heart stop and resume beating? Wouldn't each trip be literally a small heart attack? I mean, it would still be worth it, but what's going on here? Yeah, I don't feel it. No, fuck "6"! Not that one. This is all that's left. Oh, wait, wait! What if this is a trap? Ohhhh... Yeah, you wanted to drop my ass dead, didn't you? Yeah, this is the Black Mesa I know! I'M RIGHT! Now I know why it's all rotating! It's teleportation Russian Roulette-- an over-engineered way of proving you're hardcore. Perfect for scientists. These are chambers in a gun. Wow, that's a big one. Maybe it knows things. No, that would be too easy. What's going on here? Daah! Whoa, what is-- Hey! OH, PISS OFF! I CAN TELEPORT, TOO! Now what? You're not special anymore! But this is. This has the answers. I am ready. Bestow your knowledge upon-- Wait, this is that stupid room again! DAMMIT! WHY IS THIS SO SPECIAL?! WHAT'S THE POINT OF TELEPORTERS IF YOU CAN ONLY TELEPORT INTO THE NEXT ROOM?! IT CAN'T BE A PROTOTYPE! YOU DON'T MAKE NINE FUCKING PROTOTYPES WITH THE SAME DESIGN FLAW! I'm leaving! No... there's nothing here. I know that. All right, there's some I haven't tried. Merry-go-round techno bullshit... So, wait, how does this know to teleport me? Does it detect organic compounds? But that wouldn't make sense, then I'd be naked like in the Terminator. The suit wouldn't make it. I mean, maybe the suit has some carbon fiber... I don't know. But the metal wouldn't pass. Maybe it scans everything that's not the ground or air and teleports that? But then wouldn't dust pile up at the exit? Yeah, what am I talking about? "Scanners"... Okay, I haven't tried THIS one. I guess I could climb the fence. Yah! All right, I've already tried "8". The big teleporters are exactly the same. This one looks kind of fucked up. Okay, I'll try "7", then if that doesn't work, I'll climb the fence. Yeah, "scanners"... We have don't have computers that would even come CLOSE to scanning all the atoms in a human body. One fantasy at a time. Because that's what this is. There's just no explanation for anything. Ah, now I'm going to wait so that other green ball doesn't kill me. Daaaah? Oh. I overprepared. It's been a long since I've done that, since every moment has been one worst case scenario after another. Looks like it still is. What am I looking at? Obviously, no one was ever meant to be in this room or walk in it, but here I am. Is this a reactor? The Geiger counter's not ticking quite that high, but, shit... Okay, I guess... fuck... I think there's a passageway on the other end, maybe... Yeah, this is helpful! All right, well, I haven't had enough spinning today, so this is perfect. Just what I was hoping for. Okay, let's go. Wait, shit! No, noNONONO! It's too bad there's nobody shooting at me while I'm doing this! That would really complete the experience! Okay, jump... Frogger from hell... That's good... jump! WAAAAAH! Button! What did that do? Jesus Christ, that looks like a crematorium furnace. Well, the rad levels are holding steady so whatever's in there isn't any worse than what's already here. Maybe this reactor is powered by human souls. Yah! That would explain why I've barely seen anyone. I still have doubts about how much "science" is involved with these teleporters. Dah... What's that Arthur C. Clarke quote? "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"? Well, that doesn't RULE OUT magic! Button 1! Hop to it! Oh, yeah! That was smooth! Okay, so the plan is I crawl in there and somehow not die. If I start to die, then I'll stop. Yeah, I don't feel any heat. Oh, I'm here. I could've just-- All right. No sense in lamenting the past. So, do I take this? It probably just leads back to that same room, but... Wow! This door isn't locked! I didn't think that was possible. I was starting to suspect these were all welded pieces of steel, that were stolen from the supports to the building, apparently. Is this a real door? We will never know. Ah, my entourage. You're late! I have no tolerance for tardiness! Unless it's me, but you are SO obviously not me. Sleeping on the job, huh? Well, I'm not your boss. Carry on. Yeah, I can't get over it. These teleporters still make no sense. Wouldn't canceling all momentum stop my brain, too? I can maybe buy that this was a scientific breakthrough, but this is such a fundamental change in our understanding, it would take a series of breakthroughs. Huh. No, I think magic might actually have a case here. I mean, there was that coven that summoned me, and I'm pretty sure I saw some candles, maybe a pentagram. Oh, shit, he's packing! Okay, old man. Don't play with fire if you're not ready to get burned. You brought this on yourself. Wait... Who are you? Uh... What?! Whoa, wait a minute...! DAMN STRAIGHT! You just have to shoot 'em. What about YOU, tough guy? for you, Mr. Freeman. Do hurry. Okay, listen-- Yeah, whatever. Listen, this portal thing sounds great, but I need you to-- Are you serious? Are you walking away as I'm talking to-- Hey, meatloaf. Tell your friend with Asperger's, I need to get teleported to Massachusetts. Or anywhere outside of-- Oh, what now? Zen and the Art of Long Jumping, huh? Didn't take you for a Zen guy. This thing would've been great YESTERDAY! Oh, yeah! I missed this! Man, I could tackle you so hard. All right, I'll deal with you later. First thing's first. I'm seeing a lot of ammo lying around, so I'm going to assume you laid it out here for me. Thanks. That's very forward-thinking of you. I'm not even going to ask why a lab has so many small arms in here. I'm cool like that. And, hey, I can't carry two, but I'll take the rocket out. Yeah, this is good. It's just as well I'm coming through here; you two would only hurt yourself with these given enough time. Hey, it's another one of those Ghostbuster props. Why not? Does it work? Yeah, looks good. Well, you guys are just full of goodies. More shells. What is that? Well, I'm not touching THAT but I'll take more explosives. Explosives keep my options open in a way nothing else can. Now, what I REALLY need... is a wheelbarrow. But... I'll just take every single thing I can carry. But that's the least this company can do for me, and it WILL do more, but one step at a time here. What's this? Oh, these are explosives! Wow, this is the most hardcore lab storage I've seen in my life. Hello! What's this, a prototype weapon? I hope it's a weapon. Let's see. There's a trigger. Yeah, it's doing something. Hey, there's a throttle. WOW! That kicks like a shotgun! This'd better be a weapon. I really should try this on a live target, but there's going to be nothing but drama if I shoot this guy in the leg. Okay, I think I'm getting close to my limit. I can grab a couple things, but if I carry much more, I'm going to need some duct tape. All right, Tickle Me Bald Guy, we've gotta talk. Oh, he's bowing. Okay... Hey, forget this alien stuff. You need to teleport me to Massachusetts, all right? Massachusetts. That's simple enough, I think you can remember it. What the hell? Heh, yeah, I guess I am carrying some contraband. Man, it's too bad these teleporters aren't the duplicating kind, then we can just tell it to not destroy me on this end, and I can create copies of myself. Now, the conventional wisdom is if you see a clone of yourself, you should try to kill it, but I think that's the view of a small mind. Dah! All right, all right. I'm coming, just hold on. Hah! Y'know, a ladder wouldn't kill you; this catwalk has poor support as it is. There's too much stress on the beam. Actually, hold on. Is there an exit here? Like, is there a snack machine in the back or something? Because I could use that. No... Hey, I don't know what they told you, but I need you to teleport me to Massachusetts. If you can't swing that, just get me to the nearest city like Los Alamos or Santa Fe would be fine. I should be able to hijack a ride, no problem. Yeah. I'll get out of your hair. Just don't screw up. Man, if the teleporter COULD make a copy of me, I should have a plan how to unite myselves in the future, so I need to have a plan NOW before I make the jump, just in case. I guess... I'll leave contact info where I buried the gold. That'll work. What is it? AH! Shit. AH! WHAT IS THAT?! THEY CAN FLY NOW?! AH! HEY, YOU'VE GOT A FEW BUGS IN THE SYSTEM! I MEAN, A LOT OF BUGS! HOW ABOUT FIXING THAT?! I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, BUT YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG! Christ... I'M PUTTING A LOT MORE TRUST IN YOU THAN I WANT TO BE RIGHT NOW! Jesus! THEY KEEP COMING! YOU'VE HIT A NEST! WHAT?! AAH! AH! YOU NEED ME TO COME UP THERE? BECAUSE THIS ISN'T WORKING! SHUT IT DOWN! JUST SHUT IT DOWN! YOU NEED TO START OVER! I CAN'T HEAR YOU! HEY, IT'S DOING SOMETHING NOW! SHOULD I GO-- WAAAAAAAAH! I'M NOT WAITING; I'M GOING TO GO! DON'T FUCK ME ON THIS! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! NO! Christ... THIS IS SO FUCKED! WHAT?! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-- --AAAAAAA! WAAAAAAA-- Haa-haa-yehh-woo... Ho... Hey! I... think it worked! This looks like... deciduous-- Well, I'm not in New Mexico! And that's what matters. Hey, a fire tower. Maybe I can figure out where I am. I mean, did they actually get Massachusetts? Is that where I am? I'd be really impressed then. Huh. Not a lot to go on. But, hey, what a problem to have, right? I am almost ecstatic that my worst problem right now is being lost in the woods, approaching sundown with no food or shelter. I haven't heard one bomb go off or been shocked with electricity since I got here. Yeah, this works JUST fine. But the no food thing IS getting my attention, but I'm in the forest. Maybe I can kill a chipmunk and eat it. Huh, ruins. Actually, a chipmunk might be a problem. With my guns, it would just explode if I shot it. Whatever. I'll figure something out. Okay, this looks really old. And the architecture... Jesus, I might be in Europe! That could explain the daylight, though I kind of gave up trying to figure out what was going on there. You know what? I'm not complaining. Yeah, this suit has a tracker, right? HAVE FUN TRYING TO FIND ME IN EUROPE, ASSHOLES! Oh! A building! Time to introduce myself to the locals. Thankfully, buckshot is considered universal currency. EVERYBODY DOWN ON THE GROUND! GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY! I'M A POLITICAL REFUGEE! Oh. Well, maybe they left a bag of chips lying around... I'm surprised this place has power. Oh, a map! I can't read a damned thing! It's completely smudged from water damage. Why even hang it? So, this must be a ranger station. I guess I could sleep here. BUT I CAN'T EAT THESE PAPERS, CAN I?! I don't hear a generator. The power lines must be buried. That's a good sign. Well, time to go find some chipmunks before dark. Hey, y'know... If I started a forest fire, then people would come to me. No, maybe not. It's too damp. The woods aren't dry enough. J--! Or, I could just have my prayers answered! That's always my first choice! Jesus! It even has a backup can of gas! Okay, time to LEARN how to hotwire. Is this a test? No? I don't see anyone. Well, I just became a Jeep fan! I understand Jeep people now! OH MY GOD! THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION! HA-HAAA! Some ranger is walking home tonight! This is beautiful. I'll find a surplus store to sell the rocket launcher and be back on my feet in days. That's it! I win! Hey, what's on the radio? --AAAAGH! Oh! That was horrible! Wait... no! What is this?! THIS ISN'T MASSACHUSETTS! Oh no... Oh, God! They fucked me! I TOLD THEM EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AND THEY FUCKED ME! THIS IS WORSE THAN EVERYTHING! Oh, God! I feel strange...! Dizzy...! Is this gravity...?! Oh! Okay...! Okay... well, I gotta do something... This day's going to shit. All right. There's something over there. I'm going for it. NnyaaaaaaaAAAAAAA-- Oof! Are you kidding me? Fuck. Oh, he's hiding. Gee, where could he have gone? Oh, I think I see him. I think I see him. Yeah, that's right. Shoot away the madness. Oh, lovely. Here's a wonderful fucking omen. I would get a picture of this tattooed on me. This so concisely sums up everything. Just everything. And he had a helmet on so what does that say about me? Well, I'm not taking it. It has germs now. Oh, God! What's happening?! Gotta keep moving. Ha! WAAAAAAAH! NO! STOP! WHERE ARE YOU?! BLAH! YOU HAVE ALL OF INFINITE SPACE TO TELEPORT TO! I'VE ALREADY CLAIMED THIS... horrible... chunk... Okay, I guess I'll make my way to the big thing, then... ...blow my brains out, I don't know... Ha! ...don't miss, don't miss! Oh, good, it didn't flip. I'm not sure how these are floating; I guess they're filled with a lighter gas? I mean, if it was magnetism, wouldn't that affect some of my suit or weapons? Actually, I don't know what metals are on me. Dah! Eee! NYAAH! Okay, don't freak out... Don't freak out...! I SAID DON'T FREAK OUT, DAMMIT! OKAY! NAH! NUH! I'M TOTALLY NOT FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW! BECAUSE... THIS IS ME NOT FREAKING OUT! WHAT DO I HAVE TO FREAK OUT OVER, ANYWAY?! NOTHING! BECAUSE I'M NOT! I'M JUST NAVIGATING FLOATING OBSTACLE COURSE THAT LOOKS LIKE A... GIANT... PLATE-BALANCING TRICK DESIGNED BY H. R. GIGER! FUCK YOU, REALITY! YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT! AND... BONE PILLAR THINGS AND... BREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE...! NYAH! ...wwwwAAAAAAH! REALITY'S BROKE! Why is there gravity?! I look below this thing and there's just the void! Wah! Waa-aaa-AAAH! Okay, I'm clear for landing on the hell blob. So, am I supposed to believe this thing is dense enough to cause gravitational pull? I don't fucking think so! Not only is that stupid but that would've yanked me sideways with that top platform. A ledge. Why not? Whoa-ho-ho! WAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?! WAH! Shoot the madness... shoot the madness... No! WAAH! LET ME IN! God, Je..! Ah, a first aid kit. I guess somebody else made it this far. I wonder how many explorers they just dumped out here. Probably a lot. Maybe that's why I couldn't get a helmet: they ran out. What the hell is this thing? Ah! Fuck! PURPLE... PROACTIVE... BUG ZAPPERS! AH! FUCK OFF! NO! SHUT UP! STOP! NO! FOR CRYING OUT L-- THERE! Yeah, go do your little dance... you freak. Yeah, you can't even do THAT right. AH! Oh! I-- you're not worth it. Not yet. What IS this thing? Wah! What happened? Did it steal a piece of my soul? Give it back! No... it's not really worth it. Well, I guess I have a water source... maybe. Stop that! Well, I guess I'll check out the interior. Maybe I can find a weak point and blow this up. That would make me feel better. Fucking nightmare. Oh, there IS something in here. Well... yeah, it's about what I was expecting. A lot of water. If anything here is edible, I can go for weeks. Well, guess this is my new home! I'll get settled in. Is this a mushroom? I'm no stranger to mushrooms. Oh, it lights up. Dream décor for a stoner. It does make the place cozier. What the hell is this? Eh, I'll try and eat it later. Really, I need to eat those things I killed on the ledge first because they're going to rot if I wait too long. I'm REALLY hoping I can find a way to cook them because dinner is going to be harsh enough as it is. Yeah, turn on all the mushrooms, I don't care about the power bill. Okay, those blinking lights are annoying; I'll take care of that later. This, actually, isn't THE worst apartment I've ever had. It's close, though. What's this? A bird cage? Well, I'm pretty sure I can't eat rhombuses, so you're free to go. Enjoy. Well, they'd better figure out how to fly out of here or else I'm gonna swat 'em later. No, I don't want to waste the ammo. I haven't done a full perimeter check yet. So, where am I going to sleep? Oh no! Well, I can't call this an earthquake. Oh God! Ah! OKAY, THIS APARTMENT'S DEFINITELY THE SECOND WORST I'VE HAD! IT'S STILL NOT INFECTED WITH BEDBUGS! WHAT IS THIS?! IS THIS A TELEPORTER?! IT COULD SEND ME INTO SPACE! I COULD DECOMPRESS! OH GOD! THE ROOM'S CLOSING IN ON ME! THESE ARE TEETH! IT'S ALIVE! THE ROOM'S GOING TO EAT ME! SHIT! OKAY, NOT A LOT OF FUCKING OPTIONS! AAAAH! Great. Hey, what's that noise? So, what's this guy's story? He came here and he died. The end. Nrgh! Uh... I think I'm in the wrong place? This isn't--Ow! Fuck... Don't distract me! I've got... other... things on my mind. Would it be too much to ask for this thing to ignore me? Yeah, yeah it would. That should scare it off, huh? Maybe I killed it. It's just limping its final moments now. No, that's not really limping, huh? This should help. Bye! Did I miss? Here, let's do this right. I cannot think of a better use... There we go! But, just in case... let me in! Le-- I'M FREAKING OUT! I'M FREAKING OUT! I LIED! I'M FREAKING OUT! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE AGAIN! DIE MORE! Wihhhh-oooooooooo! YOUR TERMS ARE UNACCEPTABLE! WAH! AND QUIT SHOOTING YOUR WHITE... SPIDER-WEB... HELL MILK! Mroooooowwwwwww... Mrraaaaaaaaa... Mrraaaaaa... Ow! THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT! THAT'S VERY INSIGHTFUL! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT IT! WHERE ARE YOU?! I don't need to hear your opinion; I already know what it is! Oh, boy. What a day, what a day, what a day... Well, that thing ran off. That's about the first good thing that's happened since I got here. So, what's the story on this guy? Was he killed by the monster or did he just... fall? You know, that other researcher was hanging half on the ledge, like he was just fucking dumped there. I have a theory: we may have sent a LOT of researchers out here... like, hundreds. We didn't really know where to point the teleporter so we just guessed? I'm not seeing too many because look around. The odds of hitting one of these islands out of this... gaseous cloud is kind of slim. Oh, is that another teleporter? Oh, that would be perfect! Yeah! Christ... Hey, this isn't a teleporter; it's just a puddle! What are YOU looking at? Stupid aliens... Hup! Oof! Well, better than the other way. But yeah, I bet it was raining researchers all over the place. That would explain why there have been random batteries and first aid kits lying around. They probably got scattered in the falls. Oh, God! Is there no other around? Well, I'm out of rockets! I guess I'll go with the MP5; it has the grenade launcher. I don't understand how that thing is still alive! I've taken down TANKS with the firepower I've blasted into it. That thing didn't look like a cyborg. I didn't see any armored plating. Hey, what was it that guy in the lab said? There's some sort of creature, I'll know when I see it? Well, I found it. So, if I kill it, does that mean that they'll teleport me back? That'd be nice. No. They won't. What's this? Oh my God, there are rockets in here! This brings me closer to my comfort zone. But, yeah, they're not going to teleport me back. This was a one-way trip. Just like all the others. I didn't expect that! Oh... shit. Well NOW would be a great time for it to NOT charge. How is this thing alive? I need one of those mech-suits like in Alien so where I can just throw it off into the void. I'd need a lot of mass, though; this thing really throws its weight around. Yeah, that's good. You just... stay there. I have a present for you. As the Ambassador of Earth, I wish to give you this gift on behalf of my people. Actually, I have a few, you can have all of them. It's what my planet would've wanted, I'm sure of it. But, more importantly, it's what I want. I guess I'm not really the best ambassador come to think of it, but, hey, I'm all you get. Okay, now just keep standing there; this is a very important part of the ceremony. We have to get the photos and attend the luncheon... All right, say cheese! Diplomacy breaks out! NO! STAY THERE! YOU'LL RUIN THE SHOT! IS THIS A JOKE?! WHAT'S HAPPENING?! NOTHING'S IMMUNE TO EXPLOSIVES! Oh, shit! I'm out! IS THIS A GOD?! AM I FIGHTING GOD?! IS THIS WHAT GOD LOOKS LIKE?! Blah! This isn't what I pictured at all! YEAH! LEAVE ME ALONE! I'M A SINNER! WHATEVER! I'M NOT READY FOR YOUR TRUTH! DID YOU HEAR ME?! Oh, you're going to throw things at me?! FINE! I'LL THROW THINGS AT YOU! NO! NO! DON'T--! NO! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! THEOLOGISTS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT! NONE OF THE MAJOR RELIGIONS COVER THIS! NOT EVEN CLOSE! NO-NO-NO-NO-NO! Ah! I don't like where this is going; I'll eventually run out of ammo! But you'll--Ah! Ah! But you'll never run out of being an alien! A wise man once said, "Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ." Y'know, I have a new theory: I think, instead of teleporting me, maybe the scientists just blew up the universe. We found a way to do it --we were really motivated-- but since I was wearing this suit, I survived and that's why all I see are other people wearing this suit and the laws of reality and everything else just got scrambled a little bit? Whup! No, that can't be right. Then my weapons wouldn't still be here. What? Oh. Hello. Oh, wait, that's right. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. Hold still. Ow! Fuck... Yeah, I'm pretty sure the universe still exists. That's kind of too bad because the alternatives... What's this? Rockets! I kind of hope I don't need these; they're giving me nothing but bad memories. Oh, a pad thing, huh? That's convenient in a pain-in-the-ass way. Bwah! Ow! OW! Don't TOUCH me! I'd burn this whole place down if I could. And is there REALLY no other way besides THIS cave?! THIS CAVE?! Hey, that rock's levitating. It's not even spinning. All those explosives didn't cause any air currents? Y'know, I got these rockets off the dead guys; maybe they're just dummy rounds. After all, if we had hundreds of researchers falling from the sky, you don't want to equip all of them. That's a waste. Yeah, those scientists aren't going to teleport me back. I mean, for starters, I'd beat the shit out of them. I might kill them, I don't know. It depends on what they would say. Well, so far, so not dead. Fuck bubbles... Oh, it's running! Good! I like-- Whoa! Kind of slick. No! I'm sliding! NOOO! Oh, that's right. Low gravity. This is still shit. GOD! GET OFF MY FACE! YOU'RE LIKE HOPPING LEECHES! WHAT?! ENJOYING THE SHOW?! HEY, I'VE GOT SOME LEFT! MAY AS WELL USE THEM, RIGHT?! Oh! That was a good one! Hey, I've got one more! Yeah! Oh, fuck! STAY ON YOUR SIDE! THAT'S YOUR SIDE! STAY ON YOUR SIDE! Shit! Shit! Oh, did I--? Pluh! No! Yes! No! God! Stop it! Christ, I can't see! Where--?! BLAAAAAAAAH! GOD! GET ME OUT OF HERE! ANYTHING! What?! WAAAH! Well, this is different... maybe. Whoa! WAH! Don't fall apart on me! Shit. No...! Oh, you want a piece of this, huh?! Well, I've got somethin' for ya! Here! Take some home with you! There's too much happening here. Trying to confuse me. YEAH, GET DOWN! GET DOWN! It's not even reacting. Yeah, keep your dist--Shit. THUD! Yeah, there you go! That's more like it! What the hell are these things? Pustules of the Damned. The land's rejecting the aliens! Which it should! WAH! WUH-WAAAAAAH! More of them?! SPLAT! NOW THAT'S A GOOD ALIEN! Well, I will say this is better than where I just came from, but that's not saying much. Wah! I don't even understand how a small island could support something that big. What's in there? WAA-AAA! IT TRIED TO SUCK ME IN! Well, as the only zoning inspector here, I'm condemning this property as a safety hazard. You can file any complaints at my office. I'm hearing troub--oh, wow, a cave. This ecosystem IS interesting. Shut up. You're not on the Science Team. I don't care what you have to say. What, is that your buddy? Like the two of you were going to convince me of something? I'm a scientist with a shotgun. I'm unstoppable. Neee! Well, this is smaller but it's about as good as the last apartment. It's darker. Guess it's just going to have to do. What the hell is that? A spore? Well, that can't be healthy. Maybe it'll be better if I can drain the... floor. What's this? Oh, a basement! Let's take a look. Yeah, I'm going to have to clean this up. Y'know, if I had known my next apartment was going to look like this-- well, first off, I'd be very confused and would mostly want to know what I needed to do with my life in order to make this not happen, and I don't think I'd have an answer. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Turn down Black Mesa? Oh, yeah! I'll just go work at ANOTHER well-funded facility looking for PURE physics work--theoretical, no less. Hup, we've got a bit of an infestation. Can't say I'm surprised. Oh, I should reload. I forgot I took some goodies from that canister. Yeah, that was really crazy, wasn't it? I mean, how did that thing even eat? There weren't enough... things there to sustain it. Maybe it extracted something from the air? Oh-OH! Not again! NOT AGAIN! Okay, well it blocked the exit-- Okay, well-- Blah! Well, the shower fucking sucks. Yeah, this is... I shouldn't be breathing any of this. It needs to be purified with fire, but I don't really have the equipment to handle-- OH, YOU SQUATTER ASSHOLE! YEAH! THANKS! I WAS HOPING TO GET THAT TASTE OUT OF MY MOUTH! Bluh! Oh, hey, another one of these canisters. Yeah! Some grenade rounds, Magnum b-- Well, I'm glad it IS here. Hey, you know what I think happened? I bet we REALLY fucked up with the teleporter initially, and it scattered everything everywhere. Like his ammo is here and his head is floating out in space, his legs somewhere else... Whoa! What's this? It's like an... unholy dumbwaiter. I bet it would make a funny sound if I ran a stick alongside it. So, how do I operate--OH! THAT ALMOST TOOK MY HEAD CLEAN OFF! Wait, no! That would've taken it off sloppy! It would've popped from the sheer pressure! Whew! Okay, I get it... This is the servants' entrance, so once I learn how to domesticate these bastards, this might come in useful. Although that's a big assumption that I even CAN domesticate these freaks. Okay, uh... I don't get it. Why is it taking so long this time? Oh, that's it--Wait, no! That's too fast! I can't get dAAAH! AAAH! AAAAH! AAAAH! OH MY GOD, I'M TOO HIGH! NO! STOP THAT! I CAN'T KEEP MY BALANCE! WAAAAAAAAA! Oh shit! Oh shit! Okay! Deep breaths! I DO belong on a pedestal, but metaphorically, God dammit! Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay, this is a LOT better, lot better. Now I'm a little lower... and I can move my feet more than four inches. Just like that. I could sleep here if I wanted to. Though, I really don't want to do that. My life is all about adjusting expectations. Like, I might think I'm upset about something, but then I'm falling to my death, or having my face bit off, and then I'm getting shot or frozen or drowned... It's just this big merry-go-round of a new horrible crisis taking my mind off the last one. So, I might think, oh I have it bad now, but it's ALL been bad. Nothing's worse, it's just different. I'm going for it. Hup! WAAAH! Hoo, that was good. What's that island over there? It's glowing. Therefore, it must be important. I think that's how the hierarchy works around here. Whatever glows has more status. Maybe it's a teleporter. Y'know, that's kind of nice in an awful way? I keep finding teleporters from one alien hell to the next. Like the last one was horrible, but the first one wasn't... that bad? Oh, wait, that had the quake. That was awful, too. Okay... Woo! Yeah, that other island probably doesn't exist now. Uh, take cover! Who's shooting at me? Wow, this guy's motivated, huh? Oh! That was an amazing shot! I'm not even sure I can claim skill on that one. That's fate making up for all this shit. But, yeah, it's an interesting dilemma, though I'd RATHER see it as a thought exercise and not LIVE IT! Hoo! So, if that is a teleporter, do I go in it and risk a worse hell, or just stay here with the hell I know? It could take me straight into the stomach of another god spider thing. How did that exist? There wasn't enough food. Maybe it ate space krill. Hoo! Are you kidding me? I thought I got all of them. GO! BACK! TO--! Where the hell did you come from, anyway? Oh, shit! The island must be birthing them! That's what those red pits are! Oh, I've got to get out of here, then. I can't stay in THIS hell. I'll have to watch my back forever. Oh!, I could try and ride the manta rays. Sure. What's that quote? Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? Well, one: it's a stupid saying because it doesn't account for other variables. Look at slot machines. And, two: that implies everything is not insane. Friggin' pseudo-wisdom... if you're not insane, you're just ignorant. Okay, so these ARE teleporters. That's helpful... I guess? Didn't do much for him, huh? I'm seeing an awful lot of dead researchers still in their suits with blood everywhere. What kind of pressure would it take to break the seals on their...? Are those bones I just saw getting chucked out of there? Yeah! Shit! Those are meat chunks, too! Somebody got hacked to pieces! Yeah, that's blood. That's red blood. The aliens bleed greenish-yellow. You can scratch somebody else off the list. Oh, wow! Two stars! I'm surprised they can exist that close without slamming into each other. This still explains nothing about the gravity. Not a damned thing. I'm surprised I can breathe with the gravity this low. Maybe there are some denser gases trapping oxygen in somehow? This air DOES taste funny. Ah, damn. It's one of those bodybuilding aliens. How can they even get that buff with the gravity this low? Maybe they wrestle with these tendrils sticking out that try to whip you. I'm going to sneak up on them. Yeah, weren't expecting me, were you? I wouldn't expect me here. Here, this should give you something to think about. Where did that come from? It's a complete mystery. God, all that did was soften you up, too. So, what about this guy? Let's try this new weapon; it shoots straight. Is this doing anything? He's just standing there. Oh, that worked pretty well. So, this gun actually DOES something. That's great. I wonder why that guy didn't fire at me or charge me. Maybe he can't see that far away. Or maybe he's still in training so the aliens on Earth really were the best of the best, and this is what's left. Yeah, wow. You guys are slow on the uptake, huh? Are you kidding me? I don't believe this. You're actually not trying to attack me. This is a first. Okay, wow. You are doing everything right for someone who wants to live. I wouldn't want to discourage the learning process here. It looks like some of you can be domesticated after all. Good! I mean, what's the point of being king if you don't have any subjects? I feel like we're making some real progress. Eventually, I'll need you to kill your own kind who would harm me, but that's still a ways off. Nope! Okay, did you see that? This is what happens if you ever raise your hand against me. I demand nothing less than complete loyalty. Yeah, I can see some of you are going to be faster learners than others. More ammo--how many researchers WERE there? I think my theory is holding strong. Hm. Ah! Ah-ah! Okay, my foot's stuck! My foot's stuck! Ah, that's better. Well, more water. Yeah, so there's nothing here. Y'know, I think I understand the invasion now, because this place is trash. It's no contest. Earth kicks ass compared to this place. It's a series of SMALL islands where you can fall to your death and the only way to get around is a one-way teleporter. Shit. Fucking insurgents! Well, that's to be expected at first. Two more for the pile, huh? How many is this, now? Confirmed? And these are just the ones I'm finding. Oh, rockets! Yeah, this is my new kingdom now. Classic conquest. You guys really should have done your homework on humans before you decided to play this game. All right, well, you keep pumping your... I have no idea what the hell you are doing. Extracting the green venom of the land. It's not fuel. You guys don't have vehicles or machines, really. If it wasn't for that metal armor I saw, I'd suspect you don't even have industry. Let's face it, you're borderline savages and you're lucky to have me here. I'm not here by choice, that's for damned sure. But, now that I AM here, I'm going to turn this place into something. I guess I'll have to start with just-- Fuck, FUCK! THIS IS GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE PROGRESS! I NEED TO-- DA-DAAH! YEAH, FOLLOW ME THROUGH HERE, BIG GUY! LET'S SEE YOU TRY AND SQUEEZE IN! Huh, this must be the lounge. Yeah, he's not making it through this. The thing is, I knew this was going to happen. Not this, specifically, but every other place here has been its own hell. Why should this be different? What the hell? Where is this? I was there. Dah? So, this place grows the green things now? The BIG green things? Yeah, see, this is exactly what I'm talking about. I killed a handful of sleepy alien guards, found some potential minions... That's not how this place works. It has to torment me. Every jump is a new hell. Although I may luck out on this one, because I'm hoping his reptilian or... whatever brain has forgotten I even exist by now. It has been a minute or so. It should be enough time. Excellent! Yeah, you WATCH that entrance. If anything comes here, it'll be through THAT entrance. Okay, gonna keep running, just in case he gets bored. Bleh, bugs. Yeah, I am NOT over here. Keep watching that entrance. Whoa, the darkness. I don't trust the darkness. It's dark. BLAAAAAAAAAAH! I'm so slick. Jesus Christ! Are these islands alive? Is that how this works? Do they just keep growing bigger and bigger things? Oh, some more red meat chunks. There goes another researcher. Okay, time for juggling lessons. Your first lesson is to just grab the ball. Can you find it? Here's another one. Good, good. Just--no! Keep looking. Keep look--there you go. You need some more? Okay. Yeah, what's that? What's that? It's amazing, that's what it is. Yeah, go find it. It's not there anymore, dumbasses. So, beyond the smaller pink whipping things, we also have big green slamming things. Oh, I guess I'm out of the satchel charges but those went to a good cause. Hey, you know what I haven't been using? These tripmines. I think I know someone who will fall for this. I thought these could come in handy. Now, let's get his attention. Wow, I gave him too much credit. Yep! Yep. That is music to my ears. The sound of coming to terms with your own stupidity. Oh, the teleporter! So, the question is--DAMMIT! WHERE WERE YOU THIS WHOLE TIME?! SEE, THIS IS WHY I HAVE TO USE THE TRIPMINES BECAUSE EVERY FUCKING MOMENT IS LIKE THIS! I GET, WHAT, THIRTY SECONDS OF CALM? THEN IT'S SCREAMING, KILLING, AND THEN IT'S HEAD EXPLOSION TIME! THERE'S NO TIME TO PLAN ANYTHING! EVERYTHING'S JUST BLAAHHHBLAHHBLAAAH! See, I THOUGHT I'd catch a break after I killed everything, but now I think the island might just grow them forever. And ANOTHER dead researcher! What a surprise! Yeah, this guy just fell and died on impact. There's nothing more to this story. Well, he wasn't a total waste. So, do I go through? Well, they're all Hell, so I'm guessing this one is a room full of bees. I'm about due for that. Yeah, bees! Let's do it. Fuck. Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz! Bzzzz? Wow, huh? No bees. I guess I was premature. What's this? It looks like... alien rebar. It's really thick, but that would make sense, what with the low gravity. Wow, these are hallways. So far, it looks like I made the right choice coming here. That's a surprise. Okay, he doesn't see me. Let's do this the economical way. Uh-oh. Wait... Oh, okay! You just don't give a fuck. Well, if you don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck. Hell, if you guys were this chill earlier, I would've just assumed you worked at Black Mesa. Like a burn victim or something. Hm, more equipment. Wouldn't make sense for somebody to drop this here. Yeah, I think it got scattered in the process. Okay, time for a loyalty test. I need a boost and that's your new job description, all right? Good-- Hey! This is a privilege. Don't forget that. And I keep hearing a monkey or something making noises. I mean, it's obviously not a real monkey, but is there that big a difference around here? Now what is THIS? These look like integrated circuits! Doesn't do anything, but maybe I've underestimated them. Or maybe they just stole it from somewhere else because it looks valuable. It probably is. I don't know, though. This structure at least resembles something professional-looking, like they have some sort of purpose instead of just running around in circles on their islands making guttural noises. Yeah, we have lifts, barrels, lighting... This is some sort of manufacturing or processing. They're still not wearing any clothes, though, so I'm not THAT impressed. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can take this place over. It's ripe for colonization. I just need to find the leader, blow his head off, then they'll start bowing to me. Okay, I'm not convinced what I'm doing right now is a good idea, but there's literally no entrance. So, were the workers born here or what? BLAHBLABLABLAHALBALAHRRARAARARARAAARARAAAA! MY MATTER DOES NOT VIBRATE THE CORRECT WAY! NO MORE FORCEFIELDS! I AM NOT A BARREL! I NEVER WANTED TO BE A BARREL! If I see another one of those fields, I'll calmly get down and tear apart this entire room until I can disable the power. Uh oh. Okay, water! HOT! HOT WATER! WHERE ARE MY TOWELS?! YOU DIDN'T LAY ANY OUT! I'M HOLDING EVERYONE HERE RESPONSIBLE! AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY CRAP ABOUT THIS BEING A FACTORY; IT'S A SPA IF I SAY IT'S A SPA! AH! YOU'RE UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT NOW! IT'S ONLY MY FIRST DAY HERE AND I'M ALREADY SEEING DOZENS OF THINGS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO CHANGE! YOU'RE EITHER WITH MORE OR I'M GOING TO HAVE TO KILL YOU! SO PICK A SIDE! HEY! I'M TALKING TO YOU! THIS IS ABOUT YOUR FUTURE! SO, WHICH IS IT?! FINE! I didn't even see you doing anything. I saw you standing in a corner acting like you're busy. I was more impressed by the last room where there was one guy working and five standing around. That's how we do it back on Earth, too. Looks like I found my predecessor. What happened? The workers kill him? Oh, yeah. There's going to be a lot of restructuring around here. It would help if I knew what was in these barrels, or what any of this does, really. Not a problem. I'll find out. It would just be easier... ...for everyone involved... ...if someone told me. It's not laundry detergent. You're not helping! This is NOT what cooperation sounds like! Ah, the foreman. Ah, shit! YAAAH! I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR STUPID POLICIES! Oh, is that gonna crush him? Aww... You've been downsized... with a bullet. Yeah, you too! In fact, I think company policy should be to just run away from me if you see me. That would simplify my life for the next few weeks. I think these fliers must be the dominant species here. How the hell else would anything get around between these islands? Also, their heads seem disproportionately large compared to the rest of their body. Maybe they need that space for more developed brains. Then again, maybe they just puff up their heads to float around like balloons. At some point, I'm just going to have to call it quits with teleporting once I've run out of ammo. But that day has not come yet. Ooh, that one was a little fast. Did I get him? Well, I'm sure he'll let me know if I didn't. Ah, more technology. So, these aliens are at the cusp of industrial revolution development? Except they have teleporters and forcefields. What the fuck? But they don't have clothes or tools or... Okay, is this guy hostile? Eh, why take a chance? Well, he's not now. All right, this gap isn't quite big enough. I'm going to move this junk. It's heavy, too. SHIT POPPERS! HOW DID THAT THING GET INSIDE A BARREL?! OH, GREAT! THERE'S THE STORE GREETER! FUCK OFF! LEAVE ME ALONE! SHIT! THERE'S ANOTHER! YOUR SERVICES ARE NOT REQUIRED! So, they're manufacturing soldiers?! That's what's in the barrels?! Why?! So they can shoot bees?! Have they done a cost-benefit analysis of that instead of just making guns? Or maybe they have different criteria like which one makes nicer sounds. RRH! THAT IS IT! I'M GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SHOT WITH ELECTRICITY OVER AND OVER! EVEN ON MY WORST DATES, I NEVER GOT SHOCKED THIS MUCH! GOOD! GUTS! Fucking low-gravity whiffle shot... PLAY CATCH, ASSHOLE! YOU MISSED! PICK IT UP! Eh, shit... OKAY, ENOUGH OF THIS BOUNCING HAPPY FUN TIME; I'M NOT COMMUNICATING CLEARLY! STEP RIGHT UP! NICE CATCH! NOW, DON'T CROWD! AHH! THIS MUST BE THE MEAT STORAGE FACILITY! DON'T WORRY, WE'LL FILL IT UP! Hiding! AH! YEAH, I'LL STACK THIS PLACE TO THE CEILING WITH ALIEN GUTS IF I HAVE TO! What's that?! AH! Rr! Satchel charges! Yeah, yeah I found a use for them last time, didn't I? Oh, no way! More grenade rounds! Yeah, we were just DUMPING researchers here. What was the plan to get them back? I mean, there had to be SOME plan. You would lose money on the equipment alone. I mean guided rockets aren't exactly cheap. Okay... Ah, damn. I can do this. Damn! It's too slick! Well, I feel like I've been given the tools to solve this problem. Maybe I'll get lucky and it'll take out the support column, too. There's nothing of value here at all. And just in case, let's be safe. God dammit! Fucking monsters in barrels. Hey, that means the movie Phantasm was semi-accurate. NO, GO AND RUN, YOU HAD THE RIGHT IDEA! Christ, you having a meeting in here? THAT'LL CLIP YOUR WINGS! SHOULD'VE RELOADED SOONER! Okay! Quiet time has now started, so please use your inside voice if you need to be a psychotic menace to all that is good. Okay, I don't see a passageway but THIS is useful. Oh, yeah, this guy was loaded. Let's double check, does this...? Yeah, nothing. So, this is a dead end. Well... I know what this is. This is a big-screen TV if I ever saw one. It has protective doors, I just need to get them off. Well, I'm going to figure this out. I know alien TV has to be better than daytime television. Aliens don't need to babysit retired people. Something just occurred to me. This could be one of those TVs that you literally can't operate without the remote. One of the aliens could've panicked and swallowed it as a security measure once they heard me come in here. If so, then... checkmate. I'm not performing an autopsy just to find the remote. Oh, a vent. What the hell is this red stuff? I don't like how it just hangs in the air. Best case scenario: this is some sort of cleaning agent. Worst case: it's an overgrown bacteria that's already infected me, and will take over my lungs in 72 hours. I'm still hoping... ...my DNA... ...is too foreign... ...for the native life... ...to take hold. I mean, if not, I'm going to have the alien equivalent of black lung. Look at this stuff. Really red lung. Oh, okay, do I take this one or... It's probably the same thing. This is just a giant pair of nostrils. So, that means I'm about to enter the mustache. It's good to go in heavily armed. THIS IS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT! BLAH! Fucking electrical beams! I'M GONNA HAVE NERVE DAMAGE, I'VE BEEN SHOCKED SO MANY TIMES! YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT! EVERYBODY INTO THE PIT! THAT'S WHERE EVERYTHING COOL IS HAPPENING! JUST JUMP RIGHT IN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING! SEE?! YOU SHOULD'VE JUMPED INTO THE PIT! IT'S A PIT PARTY AND YOU'RE INVITED! Aww, you didn't fall the right way. Well, there are certain standards you have to adhere to. Man, I'm in the pit, too, metaphorically. I have to hand it to them--the scientists REALLY knew how to screw me. They didn't go halfway on this. I can almost respect that level of commitment, but at the same time, that's what it took to take me down. And now look at me. The big joke of all this is I don't think that this was an act of revenge. What was that? Eh, it must be nothing. These guys aren't that big on stealth. WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?! THE PIT PARTY DOES NOT STOP! BLAH! Aliens! Come out to play! ALIENS! COME OUT TO PLAY! ALIENS! COME OUT TO PLAY-AY! Yeah, that's it! They're waiting for you down there. No worries. You're fashionably late. Well, I don't see anything else. Just this architecture straight out of Willy Wonka versus Hellraiser. How did I miss him?! OH! You missed ME! Today we learned that explosive projectiles have better range than electricity arcing into the open air. You think because it's humid in here, you're the god of lightning. Well, I have news for you: you're not! So, what was I thinking about? Oh, yeah. Revenge! While there's no doubt in my mind the scientists did this to me intentionally, I don't think it was personally motivated. They sent hundreds of people here without batting an eye. There's no reason to think I was an exception. Uh oh! The thing I don't get is, I'm not sure ANY effort was made to recover the bodies. So, if we were just sending people one way, how did we learn anything? I'm not sure we did, really. We just put them in suits, gave them a slap on the back, and told them they'd figure out how to return. Classic pass-the-buck planning. Throw it... off the edge... Can't. Okay! Going up! Oh, jeez. Getting dizzy... Wuh... WAAH! AAAH! AAAH! NO! I'M SPINNING! DON'T THROW ME OFF! What? OW! WHAT ARE-- BLAA-AAAGH! BACK THE FUCK UP! THIS IS MY TURF NOW! WHAT-AAH! STOP MOVING, YOU SWIRLY FUCKS! I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STAND STILL! Yeah, that was tight! Who said anything about vomiting? I-I-I didn't say anything about vomiting. But, y'know, I mean, this would be a good place to do it, though. I can't deny that. I mean, you have this big drop and the low gravity and it'd be perfect. But, yeah, I'm not gonna vomit. I've got so little food in my stomach, all I could do would be to dry heave. I don't want to do that. So, I guess the inner ears of aliens work very differently than ours if they think that spinning corkscrew elevators are a good idea. Yeah, look at this place. They fucking love their spirals, don't they? They're screwy like that! You're screwed! Shit! More of those jack-in-the-box soldiers! I'll teach you to leave your barrel! This is what you can expect! Yeah, your bees won't save you now! There! That should--Jesus! Ah! Bees and brutes and... barrels... You know, I remember some of our soldiers popping out of a box. Now I'm wondering if they come up with the idea after watching these guys. As if they're advanced tactics or something. Yeah, look at this walkway. There's not even any guardrails. I'd say the aliens are as advanced as they are backwards, but that's an gross simplification. It's more like they're a mess of a society that's managed to stumble upon a couple of advanced technologies. Ah, satchel charges! Damn, I don't think I can carry much more. I'll just come back here if the need arises, which it... probably will eventually. Okay, nothing here except our stuff. See, this is what I mean. All of our weaponry that's been teleported here is just lying around like it's garbage. If the aliens had our intelligence, they would be hoarding this stuff and studying the hell out of it. Our weapons are obviously better than theirs. Christ, some of our scientists were studying the aliens at Black Mesa while it was under attack! That's how ahead of them we are. And yet, they have forcefields, manufacture their own soldiers, and use teleporters like they're bus stops. I don't get it. Hey, there's somebody up there. I don't trust him. He's giving me this mystical look. Ah, damn. Thought I had him. Okay... Oh, c'mon! Well, he's standing still... Did I get him? I think I did. I should go check. I hope he was their prophet. That would be a nice omen for them to dwell on. Some shells! Yeah, buckshot, alien shot, it's all the same. Man, they have tripmines lying around, too, but that's more for when I go to sleep, y'know? Okay, almost to the top and-- Oh! Are you gonna...? Yep! Man, I really hope I did kill their prophet or oracle or whatever. That actually would explain this elaborate and impractical architecture; if this was a temple? Why not? Just build it right next to the manufacturing plant. Floating island space is limited after all. If I get up there and find some religious symbols, I'm gonna wear them as a hat. If I'm lucky, they'll bow down to me. But, if not, I might at least demoralize them. If I want to go the extra mile, I could cut off the leader's head and wear it around my neck. I think among complete aliens, that still sends a pretty universal message. Eh, I probably won't do that. It would smell awful plus I don't have any rope. There hast to be SOME way to instill fear in these things. Although those fliers just come at me kamikaze even when I blow their friends out of the air. Fucking aliens, man. Oh, so here's the big surprise. Another dead researcher. Yeah, this guy just fell to his death. He wouldn't walk through the other aliens just to come up here to die. Oh, a memento! Oh, yeah. Dead explorers leave the best mementos. If it's not supplies, you get a long detailed log of what happened. I still can't believe we sent so many to their deaths. I mean, this is already more people than have ever died in the space program. Shortcut! Yah! I am the master of navigation. Well... uh... Yah! But, yeah, they didn't send me here to get even. I'm just meat in the grinder. There's a fucking Mengele on the other end of those teleporter controls, and he's not going to stop until he's teleported the entire world here or else somebody kills him. I did think it was weird how they were talking like, oh, I'm the last hope. Yet there was a gung ho security guard standing around with an arsenal of weapons and spare suits? I guess they were just all in on it, or else they were saving the guard for last since they need somebody to shoot at the Feds when they come in to shut them down. Okay. I don't want to do this, but... Going up! This is gonna suck. Oh God! Okay, uh... focus on point! Focus on point! Don't look at things! Shit, I looked at something! Oh, no! Not now! Okay! This isn't spinning as much... Stop moving, please...! Is that everyone? Wait... No, you're not the TARDIS. Okay. OH, ANOTHER ONE! NYAH! CRAMPED HALLWAYS ARE NOT YOUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, YOU IDIOT! YOURS EITHER! Man! I'm definitely not convinced these are the intelligent species around here now. They basically act like dogs strapped to jetpacks that can shoot ball lightning from their paws. They seem to be coming from the top; I guess there's something up there. Maybe that rotating spark thing. Okay, this is the LAST one I'm doing. Jesus Christ... It's spin time! Oh, shit! I need to move with it, don't I? Err, wait, no! I need to move against it to undo it! Oh God, it's happening! THIS IS SPINNING, TOO! Whuh-AAH-AA-- --AAH! Okay, that's a little better... It's calming down... What IS this? Okay, so that WAS a teleporter. That's good? Why are there no stars? I must be in a cavern or maybe a really thick cloud. I guess I should get off these floating platforms before they decide to stop floating. Hup! Yah! Now, there's something interesting going on there. Not much else to do. Whoop! Wah! Hup! Ho! Yeah, this is definitely THE hangout spot for... rocks surrounded by absolutely nothing. WHAAAAAH-HA! Well, I have no idea what this is, but this heavy metal. It has everything... except the band. Yeah, there's not much here, is there? I may have screwed myself on this jump. I'll try and remain calm. Yeah, this IS for a band! This looks sort of like the Godsmack logo. What? YEAH! GET ME OUT! CAN YOU SEE ME?! IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?! A TRANSMITTER?! HELLO! Huh. This is just random chatter. This is an intergalactic CB, but I think it's just getting old signals. Is there a switch in the back? Maybe I can set it to broadcast. No. Well, I have PLENTY of time to learn how to use this, don't I? Okay, let's try this center orb here. Maybe it does something. Check-check, mic check, hell-- --lo? AAAAAAAAAAAAAA-- --AAAAAHH! Holy shit, holy shit, HOLY SHIT! LOVECRAFT WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! HOW DID HE KNOW?! Huh, it's not attacking. Fuck! ALL RIGHT! LET HISTORY KNOW YOU STARTED IT! Stupid air resistance... What the fuck is THAT?! OH GOD! IT'S FOLLOWING ME! NO NO NO! NO NOO-- --O! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAH! Oof... Low gravity's coming in handy. What the fuck's going on up there?! WAAA-AAA-AAAAA! YOU'RE FLYING PIÑATAS IS WHAT YOU ARE! WHERE'S MY CANDY?! ANY MORE?! Jesus Christ! Sometimes I think it's so awesome being me that the universe has turn to complete shit to cope with it. This is one of those predictions I was hoping wasn't true, but... Yeah, REAL low gravity. ...but reality is clearly breaking down the longer I'm alive. Yeah! Air time! I like this! Ah! Wonderful. Well, this is good. Well, hey, now I know all the big secrets. This is why security was so tight at Black Mesa: we were killing people by the hundreds! The best part is: there would have been no evidence at all! None! Now I'm not even sure if these were Science Team members. I think they might've just been spare security guards. "Hey, you want to make an extra fifty bucks? "Just put this suit on and walk into that chamber." That's probably why we had advertisements for security guards ALL OVER the damned place. They might not have even been guards, not all of them. Yeah, I'll take that. We were in fucking New Mexico; they could've just thrown migrant workers in here. Because hundreds of scientists disappearing? There's no way they could've gotten away with that! That would send shockwaves! What was it that guy said to me? I know more than any one man should? He must've been dead serious when he said that. Okay, so it's either live in this ant colony or find out where this goes. Not much to lose! Oh, fuck. What?! OH, THANKS! I NEEDED A DISTRACTION! I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS I NEED TO DEAL WITH OR ANYTHING! OH GOD! OKAY, KEEP MOVING! I'M TOTALLY NOT FIGHTING AN ELDER GOD! NOPE! NO NO NO! THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING! IT'S JUST REALLY BIG... LEVITATES AND... LOOKS LIKE AN ELDER GOD! BUT I SHOULD TRY AND KEEP PERSPECTIVE! NUH! WE HAD DINOSAURS BIGGER THAN YOU! OR AT LEAST TALLER! WUAAH! AND EARTH GRAVITY'S WAY HIGHER, SO WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?! Fuck, I'm out of explosive rounds! Hey, that crystal's helping him! WHAT THE SHIT?! DON'T DO THAT! I'M COMING UP THERE! OH SHIT! OHH SHIT! AIR TIME! AIR GORDON! FUCK YOU AND YOUR BIG HEAD AND YOUR STUPID CRYSTALS! This is gonna hurt...! AH! FUCK YOU! YEAH! WHAT D'YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?! Oh, shit! No, no--! --no! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Oof! Fuck, my leg! WUAAAAAA-AAAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAAAH! STOP BEING ASSHOLES! I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT! I JUST HAVE TO TEACH YOU WITH MY BULLETS! LOTS AND LOTS OF BULLETS! YOU'RE NOT LEARNING! OPEN YOUR M--OH MY GOD! GET BACK! BACK! BACK! BACK! NOW STAY STILL! GOOD! YOU'RE LEARNING! Whoa! WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! I THOUGHT I GOT ALL OF THEM! DON'T YOU GLOW RED ON ME! Okay, well, you seem to be ignoring me. I'll take that. I mean, in time, I'll need you to show respect, but for now, I'll settle for not shrieking like a harpy and trying to mind-flay me. Ah, goodies. Whoa-ho! Don't have my space legs yet. Oh, here we go! Lots of stuff! More explosive rounds. See, your sacrifice would've been in vain, but now that I'm here, your life had purpose. This is what I do. So am I going to have to dig my way out of here? That's going to be a lot of work. I'm gonna need more calories to pull that off. Hey! What the hell are you? Some sort of sky lantern. Well, hey, there's the teleporter up there. Okay! Time for a physics experiment. Oh, wow! It does hold my weight. I'm the low-g man. This is sweet. Well, I can't say I'm happy to return to that guy, but him seeing me again should at least piss him off. Whuh! HEY! REMEMBER ME?! YOU REMEMBER ME! HEY, I FOUND MORE OF THESE ROUNDS! ISN'T THAT COOL?! WHOA! WELL, I THINK IT'S COOL! YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY IS COOL?! THIS SPACE-Y LASER GUN?! LET'S TEST IT OUT ON YOUR CRYSTALS! OH! I MISSED IT! LET'S TRY IT AGAIN! COOL! HERE, YOU CAN HAVE SOME! Stupid crystals... Oh, not this again... C'mon! C'MON! PISS OFF! RAAAH! STOP--! HOOOO! Okay, water...! I can do water! I hear trouble...! Where IS that?! Whoa-whoa-WHOA! That hurts even more when I'm wet! Okay! If everyone keeps their distance, no one will get hurt who is me! Draw! Wait, I said that late. Draw! Fuck it. Yeah, draw. I win. Well, this place is nice and roomy. It has a pool. Hey, there's a light up there. Is someone signaling me? I think it's Morse for "Yabba-dabba-labba-dabba-yabba-labba". WHOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAA- Oof... ...whoa! THAT WAS BAD ASS! Did you see that?! Hey! Oh, wow! You're alive! They fucked you, too, huh? Well, listen, are you any good at basketball? This might work as a low gravity court; we could use an alien head as the ball. Oh, God, you're another one of those savant fucks who doesn't know what's happening! I can't take this! This is worse than no one alive at all! Low-G cannonball! No, shark...! Get out before the shark...! Huh, this is depressing. Oh, there's another ledge; that should cheer me up, right? Because it's... rock? Whuuuuuuuuaaa--! Palmed it! Okay... let's hit--Ah! That's a little rough. Y'know, I figure--ahh--that these chambers must be pressurized. This gravity is even lower than before; I shouldn't be able to even breathe with gravity this low. Lucky me. Okay, I really don't want to jump in the shark tank again, so I'm just going to hang off. Shouldn't be too bad on my knees. Ah-ah! Free fall! Yeah, that's not so bad. Okay, do I want to go cause some more trouble? Yeah, I kind of do. I mean this place has no future. Besides, he fucking started it! Hey-hey! Me again! Yeah, happy to see you, too! Check this out! Oh, these air currents suck. Yeah, sorry! That trick didn't go how I hoped! But, hey, here's an old favorite; you like this one, right?! Boy, you're hard to please today! YOU MISSED! YOUR BODYGUARD SUCKS! OKAY, I FELT THAT ONE! MY TURN! Hey, let's stop fucking around; your existence is an affront to my species, so I've got--Oh, not this again! You don't have to--no, no, no! Are we gon-- --na...? Uh, water... Big... Wait... OH, HELL! IT'S ONE OF THOSE BIG GUYS! Oh. He's walking away. But... Yeah, this is the same place. Well, you go take a nap or whatever. Don't let me disturb you. I'm back! Can you believe I still have ammunition left?! I know, right?! I mean, what else am I gonna do with it?! Oh, this again! THIS IS YOUR ANSWER TO EVERYTHING! Y'KNOW, IF YOU COULD SEND ME TO SOME LUXURY RESORT, I WOULDN'T WANT TO COME BACK HERE! Haaah... Okay, guess I'm getting cleaned up. I see haven't changed much in my absence. You know what? You're a good roommate; you just stand in the corner and mutter to yourself. I can't ask for more than that. You know that other guy's a lot more chilled out than you are! You probably think you're enlightened with your floating and prayer motions, but, really, you're just a dick! Oh, big surprise! Big... fucking... surprise! Fucking swan dive purgatory. Well, I'm out of rockets, but I want to unload everything. It's better to die in a low-gravity ballet trying to kill an elder god than... Well, that's my only option, really. YEAH! FEEL THE STING OF DEFENSE DEPARTMENT FUNDING! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS GUN IS BUT IT'S VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE! Blah! OH, MY GOD! HIS HEAD IS A PORTAL! HE KEEPS A UNIVERSE IN HIS HEAD! I WANT IT! YES! IT'S BREAKING APART! THAT MEANS I GET TO BE THE NEW GOD! THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?! I'VE GOTTA GET UP THERE! AH! NOW'S NOT THE TIME, FUCKSTICK! HE'S MAKING PORTALS EVERYWHERE; I'VE GOTTA GET ONE! GIVE IT TO ME! I NEED A GOOD ONE! NO! I'M GONNA MISS IT! GIVE ME! Blah! That's a fucking microbe! What? Did you drug me? How long have I been out? What the fuck--?! Jesus! Did you do this?! Yeah, tell me about it! Well, you SHOULD be! I had to do S-- --O much... Christ, stop that, please. Where?! What, you're CIA? Well, you're right, but CIA? God, I don't know. Man, CIA is hardcore. I want a pardon. A pardon signed by the President. So, you're threatening me? I'm not hearing a "yes" to my conditions. Seriously, I want Hawaii. And I'm a physicist; I'm done being shot at. You understand that, right? You're threatening me, you took my weapons, and you're a fucking Time Lord. This is bullshit. I will see you up ahead. Hey, asshole! I don't work for you! Do you-- You're not explaining anything, so, to me, that say you're just going to fuck me, so why am I even talking to you? Okay, here's what you're going to do: you're going to turn this space tram around, drop me off back on Earth, then you can tell Langley that your personality didn't win me over. Correct! What? No! Okay... Shit! Okay, this is not... No! Wuah! Okay! I changed my mind! I'll listen to what you have to sa-AAAH! WHAT ARE YOU?! LIKE, I'M SORRY! I'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT! DON'T EAT ME! Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good right about now. BLAAAGH! Back the fuck up! Back it up! Keep going! AAAAAH! Stop... Just stop... Your breath smells like paint. your hour has... come again. That's close enough! Personal space! PERSONAL SPACE, YOU FREAK! Aaaargh! can make all the difference in the world. Oh, who said that? JFK? Maybe Churchill. Yeah, bye! Don't let me keep you! Oh, god! Is he gone? Am I on Earth again? Good! Well, I'm not going back. YOU HEAR ME?! I'M NOT GOING BACK! Yeah, where are we? This is Hawaii, right? That was the deal! He was going to send me to Hawaii. This doesn't look like Hawaii. Does Hawaii have a railway? I think they do. Aloha! Okay, you're going to be a crappy wingman. No bars for you. I guess this is the main island. Could be Oahu. Okay, no greeters. This kind of sucks. WAAAAGH! I'M BLIND! I CAN'T SEE! HELP! HELP ME! NO! Bl-BLAAGH! WHAT WAS THAT?! I should've come by boat. There's a lot of trash here. I'm confused. What is this? This is like Max Headroom for old people. Oh, it's a timeshare infomercial. Or traveler's insurance or some crap. Oh! Am I seeing things? No! Oh, this is perfect! Yeah, keep sweeping, zapface! You've got a lot of work ahead of you! Oh, this makes my day. Next to seeing their heads on a stick, this is about the best thing I could've asked for. I'm going to like this. Knowing that we've domesticated those things gives me some real hope. Oh, here we go! Awww... I could watch cop fights all day. Never gets old. More trash... Uh... What? Oh, yeah. It was just me. It's always just me. Hey, I get why there's so much trash. They're leaving it for the alien to sweep up! Yeah, look at that. Nobody's even trying. And you know what? I don't blame you one bit. Hey! I don't either! What's going on? Okay, I remember fighting an elder god, I won because I'm that good, then some lights flash, the CIA spook made a deal, now I'm here. Y'know, Time Lord or not, I think he might be a sexual predator. He had me completely paralyzed, and I swear to God, I thought he was going to French kiss me. That was hell. That was absolute hell. Hey, why is everyone wearing the same clothes? Is this a work camp or something? Did he send me to prison? Why would he do that? If he wanted me dead, he could've just left me where I was, but he recruited me, so what's my mission? I don't know these people. I think I'm in the future. That alien didn't get a job sweeping overnight. Oh, great. I don't even have my ID. This is going to go well. Yep. All right. Uh... Hi. I'm a political refugee seeking asylum. My government betrayed me. Yes! Citizen! Exactly! I am a citizen! Now we're getting somewhere. Oh yeah. Argue with bureaucracy. Good luck with that. Hey, I don't have an ID, but you can look me up by Social Security number, right? Yeah, yeah. Oh, what the hell is this? You do dental work here, too? The chair doesn't have any restraints. You'd get yourself killed trying to torture somebody in this. Okay! Guess I'm wrong! I'll play dumb, then bash him as hard as I can. What? Not ringing a bell. Pervert. Yo! What? I don't know what's going on, guys. Respect! I need an address. Blah! Okay! Fine! I don't even know what's happening. I don't care if you get fired. keep going until you're in the plaza. So that's Kleiner's errand boy. This makes more sense now. Hmm. Well, I trust Kleiner... and that's about the whole list, so... Yeah, all right... RAAAAAAGH! I can only assume there's a reason for doing this. I'm too confused to know if I have problems or not. So, why is Kleiner in Hawaii? He's probably in one of the observatories trying to pinpoint where the aliens came from. Did the CIA grab him, too? Oh! Is this what I think it is? Put it... in the trash can. Ah! I see my reputation precedes me! All right. How about from here? This is good. Easy. You know how many sodas I drank in college? Seriously, I'm the master. Hey, was that on camera? No... I could've made that shot blindfolded. I'm not even joking. I've thrown thousands of soda cans. I got my degree under the tutelage of Dr. Pepper. Oh, a food line. Well, I don't have an ID so that's out. I'll just steal something later. There's too many cops here. It's best to grab it out of somebody's hand on the street because they'll chase you, but they won't file a report over a stolen hot dog. Ooookaaay... this is definitely not Hawaii. Yeah, they fucked me. The CIA fucked me. What's that lettering? Is this Russia? Eastern Europe? Dammit. So I have no money, no ID, and I'm lost in another country. What a great plan this was. Well, I'm just going to have to hustle my way out of this. Yeah, you'll do. A-ahem. Hey, girl! How you doin'? What the hell? What's going on? Desperate women love me. This is a complete shit show. The CIA creep said he had an important job for me. You know what would've helped? Knowing what my job is? What's this? A Gestapo raid? Yeah! Great place to drop me with no information! I'm surprised he didn't send me here naked. That really would-- Oh my god. It's a Tripod. It's a fucking Tripod! Uh... I gotta get out of here. They're real! How did we-- No, I'll figure it out later. I've gotta hide. This explains a lot. Well, they're not Capping me. I'll kill everyone in this city before I let that happen. Tripods... That must be where these friggin' servo-skulls came from, too. Everything's changed. Hey, are you two Capped? How do you live with yourselves? More cops... Well, they don't sound Capped. I guess that means I don't have to kill them. I need a gun. Well, Kleiner's here, so I guess I'll hide out until his lackey gets off work then find out where he is, because it would've killed him to take three seconds to give me an address. Nobody knows what they're doing. I see THAT hasn't changed. Yeah, what was his name? Barney? I did find it kind of hilarious how he's like, "It's me from Black Mesa." Dammit, not this way. I mean we had, what, 15,000 employees at that facility alone? He's talking like we're best friends. I don't even remember him. "It's me, Gordon, from General Electric." Oh, more cops. Great. I feel safer all ready. Maybe there's a roof access up here. Oh. Hi. No go on the stairs. So now what? Man, fuck the CIA! You know what the problem is? We didn't negotiate. All I said was "Hawaii", but I would've taken Jamaica, Cayman Islands, anything like that. Hm. I could just burn this place down. There was a lot of junk at the bottom of the stairs; I could start a fire there, everybody comes running: "AAAAH!" then I could loot the building while they're putting it out. Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. My situation's only maybe hopeless, not set-fire-to-everything hopeless. Hello, neighbor! Look at you. You're like a magical white rabbit. If you run away from me, that means I should follow you, right? Oh, I know THAT look. That's the look of wisdom right there. You've seen things. Well, I have, too. What are you drinking? No, this is me rocking. The door to your mind, man. Dammit, I know you have the answers, but I don't want to seem too eager. That wouldn't be cool. Well at least somebody's on the path to enlightenment. Freeze! Uh--yes, I am. Oh. I should leave. Something's up here. I don't want any guilt by association. These people are running a commune or something where they don't think anything of a stranger walking into their home. Oop, trouble in paradise. Yeah, this has "not gonna last" written all over it. Hm. It's either a commune or an open house with bad timing, but I doubt that. That lady didn't look like a realtor. Sure. You got any drugs? You look like the type. I don't have any-- Yeah... Hey, you know what? When people are screaming and running one direction, I find it's best to just not question that and assume they have more current information than I do. I don't like learning things the hard way-- --but I love letting other people learn the hard way for me. Oh, shit! Those were gunshots! I knew this place was bad news. Those people obviously have their own problems and I'm going to let them keep them. That's a big building. WHOA! Jesus! They're shooting at me! Okay, let's see you chase me here. Oh boy... oh boy... Gravity still doesn't love me. Or rather, it loves me too much. OH MY GOD! NO! GET OUT OF HERE! I HATE YOU! Aah! Aa-aah! This is the second-worst day of my life! Or maybe third-worst! FUCK! Oh, this is something! I'll take it. Okay... that's one cause of death off the list. WOOP! SPLINTERS! BLAGH! No-NO! Not this! NRAAAGH! Owwww-hoo-hoo-owww... You a nurse? I need morphine! Owww-how-how-hoowwwww... Fuck's going on here? Hey, we should get their guns. They're not here. They don't even have their stun prods. She must've collected them and thrown them out the window. Why did she do that? How did she take down a room full of cops? Must've been an explosive, huh? A mailbomb or something. You know, where I come from, killing cops means they send a lot more cops. Oh. I'm not sure I remember your father. Listen, smart-ass. I don't-- Oh, okay. Well fuck you then. Yeah, I talk a lot, but that's because I GET THINGS DONE! No? There were hundreds of people with doctorates at Black Mesa. Are we being watched? Did you check behind those barrels? What's with this "Get Smart" shit? Why'd you jump that? There's stairs here. That's bad for your knees. I know. You're just jumping for no reason. All right. That is a GREAT idea. You're a good nurse. Oh. You meant the vending machine. Ah. Sure is! Okay, time to go see the chief. You can wait outside. Hm! Nice setup! Yeah, those tanks could hold full bodies. Where did she get to? I'm just going to act like I've been here the whole time. Oh, what...? You're ruining everything! Don't make him explain himself! Barney of trapping and-- Just leave! Ha-hey! Oh! GOD DAMN RIGHT! That's a good way of putting it. It follows ME. Ah! Yeah, I bet! She killed five cops! They're going to smoke this place. No, you SHOULD worry! This-- Ehh... What's that on her hip? Are you thick? He obviously killed a cat in an experiment. You people don't know Kleiner. Yeah! You gotta go find that cop-killer, huh? Man, I'm getting a bad vibe here. I was hoping Kleiner and I could get back to doing some real science, but now I think there's so much heat, my whole future's-- AAH! Kleiner, this is dark. But your lab, your rules. If you want to kill your assistant, I'm not going to stop you. OR IS IT? The years have not been kind, huh? How many people HAVE you killed, Kleiner? You know, I thought he was the dumb one, but you're as green as they come! You know they mind-rape you, right? You're like this little bobble toy here. You're going to learn things the hard way. Oh no. He wants me to put that on? Kleiner, I've got a lot of bad memories with those suits. Can we...? Oh no. He's giving me the look. I'd better do what he says. I know that look. I think I'm the only person here who realizes just how dangerous Kleiner actually is. Grah... Yep. These hands are made for strangling... ...and theorems. It IS tight. I think I AM more buff. The invasion was a marathon! Hey, what about the helmet? See, this is what I mean. Oh, so I can turn on that voice again? No, I'm good. "They"... That's the Tripods, right? Shut up. Yeah, this place is going to get raided soon, but I'm not worried about Kleiner. He's a survivor like me. Yeah, look at that. I bet I haven't seen half of his bag of tricks. He probably just has to hit two switches and his printer will transform into a shotgun. OOF! That prick's doing that on purpose. I'll deal with him later. Hey, that's me in the photo! I don't even remember taking this. Was I high? Okay, that guy next to Kleiner looks familiar... and there are a lot of the Einstein-hair guys... ...I don't recognize anyone else here. Why does this look like it was taken in the 1800s? What's going on?! Is this an alternate reality? I've been hopping across space and time here... Oh, this should be good. We're going to have some REAL fun. With pleasure! Harvard, huh? Behold! "We've come for your daughter, Chuck." Ha ha ha. You're going to get a show here. This is so sweet. Amazing. Yeah, you might die. Awww... Man... Not in the slightest! You realize that the voltage is so high to blow the plug out of the wall, this can't be close to stable. OH! LOOK AT THAT ARCING! Hahaha. This is going to be like one of those dunking booths at the fair, except instead of dunking you in water, you're going to get dunked out of existence. Come on! Come on, come on! YES! That was beautiful! This is what it's all about right here. Kleiner, you have any champagne? Oh, bonus. It is. Dr. Freeman proved an able assistant. Kleiner humor. And what are you?! A middle-aged high school dropout?! I'M A DOCTOR, SHITMUNCH! MY RESEARCH WENT INTO THIS! Not that you'd understand! If I find a dog toy for you to chew on, I'll be sure to bring it to you! Taking shit from a guard... No wonder Kleiner doesn't mind killing you. Hey, this one's not green. Yeah, you'd BETTER try to get on my good side. Oh, I'll be back. Ah, I knew it. Shut it down... Hey! The current's off! SHUT IT DOWN! Oh no! Not again! SHUT IT DOWN! THIS IS BLACK MESA ALL OVER AGAIN! Oh my god, BEHIND YOU! WHAT'S BEHIND YOU?! IT'S RIGHT THERE! STOP IT! Oh god! Who are YOU?! I DON'T KNOW! KLEINER, SHUT IT DOWN! JUST SHUT IT DOWN! IT'S GOING TO SEND ME BACK TO THAT ALIEN WORLD AGAIN! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME, KLEINER! DON'T SEND ME BACK THERE! I CAN'T GO BACK! IT'S STILL THERE! KILL IT! RAAH! WHUH! KLEINER! SHUT IT DOWN! I CAN'T MOVE! KLEINER, WHY?! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?! OH! Oh! Oh God, paparazzi. No! NO PHOTOS! I'M A VICTIM! I DON'T WANT THIS IN THE NEWS! THIS IS BETWEEN ME AND KLEINER! WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS! YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT! Are they following me? Oh, God! I'm still shaking! I'm still not convinced that the field is fully off and I won't just get ripped away any second. So what now? I guess I should get breakfast? DAH! I'M DONE! NOT AGAIN! What? I don't know where anything is. I gotta look after Dr. Kleiner. He can look after himself! What? Hey! No, hey! Stop goofing around! I need a gun! I know you have one! And some cash! Are you going to make me come up there? This is such a clown show. Well, I guess I believe him when he says I should get out of the city. Why did he hand me a crowbar? That's weird. How about a map or a phone number? GUESS I'LL USE IT SINCE I HAVE IT! I could've climbed this. Dammit, you know what the problem is? I just got Kleinered. I have a hundred questions I need answered, I need supplies, but instead he distracted me, got me excited about his experiment, then almost got me killed--again-- and now the experiment's done, I'm out the door. Dammit, Kleiner! Oh--OH! NO! NOT AGAIN! HAH! BLAH! FUCK YOU! Okay, I guess that IS a good use for the crowbar. Like a giant robot mosquito. See, I'm adapting. HOLY SHIT! This is bad, bad, BAD! That is the one advantage I had and now it's gone! DAH! What do I do? What do I do?! Uh! I'll run! Yeah, they'll never think of that! Huh? Oh, God, God, GOD! WHY ARE THERE SO MANY COPS IN A RAILYARD?! This has gotta be a fascist state. How does that go? Mussolini made the trains run on time? AH! NO! HOW DO YOU HAVE A LINE OF SIGHT?! Oof! JESUS! Do they get a bonus if they hit me?! Are they climbing the fence? Good. They're lazy. Yeah, I guess the trains WOULD run on time if you have 20 fucking cops waiting to blow your head off! Maybe they think I'm a conductor. Oh! Sweet concrete! I never thought I'd miss you so! Okay! Time for our morning jog! Nope! This is a problem! I guess my only play is to be cool and walk by. "Hi, officer. I'm just a goon in body armor holding a fucking crowbar. "Nothing suspicious here." AH! STOP THAT! OKAY, YOU'RE PLAYING FAIR! EN GARDE! GUN! YES! THEY'RE ALREADY LOOKING FOR ME! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK I'M DOING, TRYING TO RUN?! No, I just woke up today and decided to bash some cops' heads in for no reason, y'know? Oh no. DROP IT! FINE! DO IT THE HARD WAY! Crossing lines here... Gunning down cops. Now I'm no better than what's-her-face. And she's the reason they're after me! I swear to-- AH! Yeah! Why not?! I'm in this deep; might as well keep shooting. See, that's the-- Ah! Oh wait. Pigeons aren't cops. That's just a comic book, or... something... Okay, things look kind of quiet. Maybe I'm finally a step ahead now. Though that railyard looked pretty quiet, too. God, they were right on top of me! Did that Barney guy tip them off? Wait, am I just a decoy? Yeah, I see you. Why did Kleiner make me wear this suit if he sent what's-her-face in just her clothes? I still don't have a helmet so it wouldn't have saved me from an overload. Are they just using me as a diversion to draw fire off them? Ah, I've gotta get out of here, though. The cops are not THAT far behind. As soon as they figure out how to climb a fence, I've got problems. Eh, this train's going too fast. Maybe... Oh, it's slowing down! Maybe I could freight hop. Shit, it's stopping. That was quick. Oh, you know what? We're going to make this work. Yeah! Playing Frogger will save your life! Especially if you're... ...a cop-killer. So, I still need to-- OH, THEY'RE HERE! JEEZ! THAT WAS CLOSE TO MY HEAD! WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING?! Oh, that is bad! BAD BAD BAD! YEAH! SHOOT UP A FLARE SHOWING EVERYONE WHERE I AM JUST IN CASE RADIO'S NOT ENOUGH! Oh my God! It's a box of bullets! The gods are watching! But not you! This society is so strange. I can't imagine a box of bullets left at a construction site and no one taking them. They're the right caliber, too! Yah! Don't panic. Keep moving. Fuck... These Charles Bronson motherfuckers aren't giving up, are they? Fine! I don't know what country this is, but I can speak their language! Complete sentences, too! Yeah, they must've found a stepladder or something to get over that fence. They really are some trigger-happy fucks, though. I never once heard a "freeze" or anything in Russian. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL! BLAH! SPIES! Stupid flare... They saw me before I saw them! Why is this stupid suit orange?! It should've been urban camo. WHAT WAS THE PLAN, KLEINER?! WHAT WAS THE PLAN? More bullets! Is this on purpose? Is this some sort of predetermination? Ah! They don't even wait to aim! You just fire! You see something moving, you fire! Fucking cops... There's too many... let's go! Oh, a vent! This is some sort of smuggling operation. More bullets! What the hell kind of vent is this?! IT'S NOT VENTING ANYTHING! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LEAD ME TO SOME WAREHOUSE WHERE I CAN SNEAK OUT THE OTHER SIDE, NOT BACK INTO THE FIRE! Fucking Christ! There's no end to them! RAAAH! Well, that's it! I'm fucked! Are they retreating? No options! Aaaah! CAN'T YOU SEE I'M IN PAIN?! WHAT THE FUCK?! WAAAAAAAH! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?! Did he just pour burning oil on me?! Is this is the Middle Ages?! Is this a siege?! Go away! Do they think I'm trying to siege the rail line?! Is that why they're fighting to the death?! They think I'm trying to conquer their homelands?! This is different than fighting soldiers. Ahh! With soldiers, I was one enemy among many. Here, I'm all they have. I can't get a shot... Okay, run then? This seems to be the answer to everything: run and shoot people, and... run... and... run... Oh! Maintenance door! Be open! Be open! NO-HO-HO! Oh! A helicopter! That's... that's wonderful. RAAAAAAAAAAH! I'm not getting breakfast this morning, am I? OKAY! PANIC TIME! Wait, no. Don't panic. This is a math problem. If I stay here, I die. If I'm somewhere not here, I may or may not die. Therefore, EVERYONE ELSE MUST DIE TO MAXIMIZE MY PROBABILITY OF ME NOT DYING! Okay, I'm jumping ahead some steps in the logic, but I'll figure out the proof later. COME ON! WHAT THE FUCK?! Oh? OH! OOOOH! Oh, that is amazing! THE TRAINS WILL RUN ON TIME! It didn't even brake. Boy, this society... ...has its highlights! I may be Public Enemy #1, but all that pales compared to keeping the train schedule. Arrival times are the word of God here. So that should've bought me at least--AT LEAST-- five minutes before they catch up with me again, right? I mean, I'm sure they'll find a way to blame cops that have been sliced in two on me, and not the train. They'll write up in their report that I have katanas for hands or something. I think they're going to blame me for everything. That's how this got started. They're obviously looking for some sort of a cult leader of that complex I was in. They must not have found him, but I was on the top floor, therefore I'm in charge, so I'll do just fine. At least that helicopter's gone. It IS, isn't it? I don't know why they gave up. Probably need to refuel. This is really a shit route, actually. I'm stuck in a canal next to a train line. Gee! Where could I be going next? Here. AAAH! That was a close one! Fuck... I just did you a favor! OKAY, FINE! I'M GOING! IF YOU DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE DROPPING IN FROM THE SKY, YOU SHOULD'VE LOCKED YOUR CEILING! What's going on?! That thing was about to kill us! Is everyone here stupid?! Eh, I'm not getting through this way. Oh, damn! I think I know what happened. I bet that alien was that guy's slave. Aaaah... Okay, I'm busting this. I guess that makes me the asshole, then, but how was I supposed to know that? I mean, isn't that even safe-- BLAAAAH! JESUS CHRIST! EXACTLY! SAFETY FIRST! If I wasn't pressed for time, I would've confirmed that was load-bearing, but being a fugitive, I'm breaking the rules. That's kind of the whole point. Fuuuuuck... These things are here, too? OH! It has an inner mouth! That is just like "Alien"! I don't remember THAT! Oh, human skull. That's nice. Yeah, I don't think Yorick was digested slowly by some xenomorphic hell-mouth. That would've changed the tone of "Hamlet". That's a boiler or something. A literal ton of scrap metal just lying around like the bullets. Oh, great. Gunshots. But they're not at me. That's so weird. It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood... Won't you be my neighbor? Nope! You're not a good neighbor. Too much baggage. Yeah! You're the sort of neighbor I was expecting, full of your own opinions about me. Oh! Hello, neighbor! Too many neighbors. This is a bad neighborhood, really. Even in the worst neighborhoods I've lived in, the cops never shot people and just left the bodies. That's a sign of falling real estate prices right there. I wish these people lasted longer; the more they're shooting at THEM... ...the less they're shooting at me. All right--BADA BOP BADA! ...booda bop ba... WHOA! WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! HE WASN'T EVEN LOOKING AT ME! HE WAS LOOKING OFF TO THE SIDE SOMEWHERE! Officer Multitask to the rescue! That surprised me. These cops keep me guessing. Yeah, this is Station 12. What do you want? We heard 12 go down and out. are targeting railway stations. This radio looks 50 years old. Manhack...? filling the underground with manhacks. What's a manhack? Over. I don't think I'm transmitting. What are these? Hm. Going with this 50s vibe, I'm imagining manhacks are Robby the Robot models holding machetes and making chopping motions as they walk towards you. That would LOOK scary... Dah. ...if avoidable. Oh! How should I handle this? DON'T LOOK AT ME! Yeah, what the fuck? These are militarized cops. Look at this. What is this substance? This is-- This is a gun nest. Now, I'm a cop! I mean, that's all cops do here, right? Shoot things? JAYWALKER! YOU'RE IN VIOLATION OF AIRSPACE! YOU'RE IN VIOLATION OF GROUNDSPACE! YOU'RE ALL UNDER ARREST! NOBODY MOVE! I MEAN IT! STOP MOVING! DAMN! LOOK AT WHAT YOU MADE ME DO! STOP RESISTING! STOP RESISTING! Are those barrels really-- Wow! I didn't think that would work! Intercept! INTERCEPT! Nope, I'm gone. Looks like I'm getting kicked off the force. Do I get a 21-rocket salute? Yeah, looks like I do! What's going on? What country gives its police guided missiles? That's literally more firepower than RoboCop. I don't recognize their uniforms either. I would've remembered the Gas Mask Police. So let's recap: The Tripods have invaded; we didn't fucking clean up the existing aliens, apparently; we've enslaved the electric ones-- although we've even managed to fuck that up because we've made them PERSONAL slaves, which is...totally irresponsible... Ugh... And the police must've been Capped--that's why they have the helmets-- and they shoot at everything. They don't even look. So what's the point of even having police? Why not kill everybody and cut out the middleman? Aah! Why do people do that?! I'm sure they'll never find them. Yeah, this is what's known as a fool's errand. Everybody's dead. Everybody. No one's coming. Why are you in a prayer position? Is this the way to Mecca or something? You know what? Stopping people who are determined to get themselves killed has never been my thing. If I heard a hundred gunshots next to my escape route, I'd assume it'd been compromised. Ooh! Yeah, I'm not here. That guy in orange is...miles from here. Shit. Great! There's the reset switch! I had my one minute of respite where nobody knows exactly where I am because they're all dead, now the trail's white hot again. They're... I'll have to make them...double-dead the next time. Fucking sewer cops... What? Nope! I'm not hanging around for this. Did they say "suspect"? OH! They're dropping flaming barrels and I'm considered a suspect! Jesus! Even if I dove, that could've collapsed my lungs! I mean, maybe... That was on the surface, but water's not that compressible. My suit would've helped but-- Dah! You're confusing me! I can't do the math for this one in my head. I'd need to know the kinetic energy of the barrel and how much compression my suit would've blocked. Without my helmet... Dammit! I don't know if you would've killed me or not! You guys are assholes! That's the only definitive conclusion. How are all these barrels blowing up? They must have fumes inside them. God...! Yeah, I'm right here, everybody... Send every man, woman and child who can fire a gun. Oh! Another box of bullets! Geez, I'm flush! They must issue these with the officers! No wonder they were lying around, they must've dropped them. ...coming out of the woodwork. "Yeah, welcome to the force. Here's your badge. Here's your box of bullets. "Now, don't come back until you shoot somebody." DAMMIT, I WAS JOKING! Okay, let's try this barrel theory. Huh. HO-HO-HO-HO! Captain Combustion reporting for duty! I don't get it. This shouldn't be happening. I mean, all of this, but the liquid-to-fumes ratio must be stored in the most unsafe way possible. Is it on purpose, or--? Christ! Come to provide some theories on the barrel combustion dynamics, huh? I don't think you're qualified. Especially not now. But yeah, the cops seem to be using them on purpose. They must've been modified to combust easily. So they're retrofitted to be a poor man's explosive? They don't seem that poor. They have gun nests and missiles. Maybe the idea is to make it easy to kill everyone with anything anywhere at all times. Everyone must die. Before lunch. Hey, there's a light on in there. I thought this was the end. Empty fuel barrels... I don't think I should drink the water here. Dah! Oil slick! OHH, SHIT! THEY'RE TRYING TO EAT THE BARRELS! UGH! PUKE SHOWER, JESUS CHRIST! THIS IS A TRAP! Okay, slow--WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA whoa whoa whoa... Ah. Yeah, this is about what I should be expecting out of life, huh? Tongue bath from hell. Actually, most tongue baths are a bad proposition when you don't know the parties involved. Well, I'll say this. This is going to change science-fiction forever. There's not going to be any more "E.T." or "My Favorite Martian". People won't understand. E.T. won't be phoning home. He'll be waiting for you in a dark tunnel ready to strangle you while he literally eats you alive. If you're lucky, he'll snap your neck first. People of the future will understand THAT. Okay, so what am I doing? I guess shimmy along this wall, though I don't much--WHAAAWHOA! WHOA-OO JAH! Jesus CHRIST, that is slick! Slip 'N Slide, slip and die, everybody slippin', havin' a good time... Now THERE'S a thought. Yeah, that's a GOOD thought, as long as I'm not standing on oil that'll burn me alive if I ignite it. Oh yeah, it's got some in there. Okay, let's do this. Oh, there it goes. Okay. Oh, nice! Dah! Gyah! DAH! OHHHH! Yeah, that's a tough pill to swallow, huh?! Kill everything with barrels. This is "Donkey Kong" warfare. Okay, slippin' time. Yeah...! Oh wow, that's a strong smell. Bleh... Oh my god! Is the Earth even worth saving? Are we too late? I mean, look at this! What... HEY, THAT ONE'S TONGUE IS DOWN! I don't even understand how these things got here. I thought they grew into the ceiling but these are on open mesh. Dammit, that's another one. Fuck... So does that mean these things are mobile? Ah! Shit...! Well, I haven't seen them move, but... I don't really want to think about that. I don't want to be here, really. Oh! What the hell? They must've heard my gunshots. Still, they didn't even see me. They're just throwing it out there, just in case? I don't see anyone. I mean, what are the odds of me being exactly there? Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way; it's just some guy sitting around saying, "Oh, there's a fuel barrel. Better blow it up." I still don't understand everything here. I guess--OH! Do they know I'm here or are they just... tossing these every thirty seconds? Fuck YOU! Shit. I guess Donkey Kong's really not that far off. Man, it's hard to shoot when I'm swimming. I keep wanting to paddle with this hand but I know my muscle memory will betray me and I'll shoot myself in the knee. Or the head, why not? It just depends on what stroke I'm doing. Okay! Suppressing fire! That's today's show's secret phrase! OH NO! THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT-- Barrels... I fell right into it! Right into it! C'mon! Run...RUN! I CAN'T AIM LIKE THIS! BACK OFF! Oh, you're fucked now. See ya! Catch ya later! Okay, is that all of them? Nope, nope! No... Damn, that guy's far off. God, this is such a fish-in-a-barrel layout... Where'd that come from?! Was that an echo? Nope, there he is. Jesus... Yeah, accuracy doesn't matter so much as hitting the person once. I mean, if you miss somebody ten times but hit them once, who's going to say you did a bad job? Them? Another barrel. Why take a chance? What? What's going on? Was he already dead and just lying there, or...? Was he trying to ride the barrel off into space? Everything's so counterintuitive. My whole career I've always tried to figure out what's happening. That's why I was so good at my job. Well actually, there's a lot of reasons I'm so good, but that's part of it. But these past few days I ask questions and the answers don't make sense at all. Yeah, like him, just sunbathing here with his clothes on. An inquisitive mind is no good here. Now the more I learn, the more the answers are either stupid or crazy. I'm not an elder god at all, am I? I didn't get any of his powers. This sucks. I mean, what am I doing here? That Barney guy sent me this way, right? Is he trying to kill me? "Yeah, Gordon. Take the canals, right? "Then the police can shoot at you from above while you're trying to swim, "and can completely surround you without getting caught in the crossfire." See, that's his brilliance. Even now, I don't know if he is just that dumb or if I fell right into his trap. Incompetence can be really hard to distinguish from malice. Okay...? No. I dealt with this incompetence-or-malice dilemma all the time back at Black Mesa, but I feel like the stakes have risen since then. It's not about sabotaging my project anymore, it's about murdering my--shit. Yeah see, I get tired of hearing explanations of whether people trying to kill me is an accident or not. I'm thinking I should take him out next time I see him just to be safe. But... No, I can't do that. Kleiner would never forgive me for killing his assistant without providing an adequate replacement. I guess I'll just have to keep my eyes open. So where's the--WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA! Ugh. Too much oil... Oh, that's great. Yeah, take a photo, huh? Oh my god. Shooting! Don't you understand?! BLAH! YOU DID IT AGAIN! NO! Stop, stop, STOP IT, STOP! JUST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SHOT BEFORE DOESN'T MEAN I'M ANY BETTER AT IT NOW! Fuck this... fuck this...! I don't have any cover! Uh, think quick! OH OHH! Fuck Barney! This is the worst route! THIS IS THE WORST ROUTE I COULD'VE TAKEN! WHOA! Yeah, I needed more problems! Oh god, GOD! A DOOR! FUCKING MOVE! Don't be locked, Christ! Finally! Got one! Oh! Ohhhhh... YEAH, COME FLY IN THE DOORWAY, ASSHOLE! Ohhh... Yeah, underground's good. What is...? Fuck you. You're dead. I'm not listening to you. I'm robbing you. Yeah, I guess I'll need more of these, huh? Well, as shitty damp dead-ends go, I'm more appreciative of this one than I have been in a while. Y'know, the last time I tried to live underground forever, it didn't work out because I got hungry, but maybe this time's different. Actually I don't remember what happened. It was nothing good. Yeah, you know all about "nothing good", huh? Fuck! He was torched. What's here? Oh, that's nice. Looks like a body back there. Yeah, that's just what I'm looking for. Wait, no. I'm not. This water's contaminated. Do the Tripods not need water or something? Are they robots? That would be a curve ball, wouldn't it? I suppose I could--WHUP! Fuck that... I have to kill it... ...kill it before it's too late... ...kill... ...keep killing... Oh my god... Okay, I have to go easy... Easy... Easy fucking does it! EASY! Well that's not happening again. What the hell?! Oh, he probably saw my flashlight. I'm surprised. It's broad daylight. Yeah, just keep shooting that spot. That's good. That's good. Oh, that was traumatic! Even amongst the blur of trauma my life has become. Honest to--OH HO HO HO HO! No, no. Fool me once, you almost fucking kill me. Fool me twice, no. Okay, come on. You will be my emissary. I trust you to communicate on my behalf. Damn, a little LOUD, but that's what I would've said, too. Christ, they're eating the scraps. Here, have everything, you fucking hell-goats. If I wasn't bitter, this could be entertaining. Ugh. Okay, I'm going to slide down here and shoot up like a bad ass. Uhh... Damn, I guess this ramp's not as slick. Okay, I'm getting out of here before I get choked twice. Not again, NOT AGAIN! I am legit traumatized. I don't even want to eat spaghetti anymore. Okay, it sounds like he's still aiming at that one spot, so--Nope. Y'know, I'm really not happy with how many times I'm finding myself saying, "It could be worse." I mean, yeah, I could be dead. That's worse. That's a nice low bar for us to judge things by. Fuck. Okay, I didn't get a good look; so the real question here: Is that helicopter being piloted by that Barney guy? Actually, hold that. Can I stay down here? No, I'd have to eat the aliens. That's not fucking happening. So, uh... hey, I have an idea. This is the most basic ruse there is but these cops seem to have more bullets than brains. HEY! OVER HERE! I'M A LIGHTNING BUG! That's good! That's good! Just keep firing there! Keep firing! Maybe you got me! C'mon...shit! ...home base... Oh! You bastard! Okay, my turn! I don't think that did anything. Well you win this time, Barney...if that IS your real name. Okay, I don't KNOW that's him, but I sort of sense it, y'know? I mean, he sent me in the canals, I know that much. Wow. More bullets. I really could just stay here firing at him, but I think that's what he wants. See this is what makes me the last man standing, because I'm not just standing here. Well, that and being bullet-proof... ...except for my head! Kleiner... Okay, so I guess I really am trying to get lost at this point because if I can't find me, they can't find me. Well, that's actually not really true, but there's probably a correlation. There's a lot of junk down here. I don't know much about this society, but I think they make it too hard to do trash pickup. Maybe they charge too much, or knowing this place, you have to present three forms of ID to throw away a can. Oh! Maybe that's what that cop was doing--making sure I was certified! DRINKING SODA COULD'VE SAVED MY LIFE! Okay, this is boarded off. That's good. If I'm lucky, this won't be on a blueprint so they'll think I've ceased to exist. What the fuck? Railroad, covering our tracks. Well, you didn't try to kill me... So you've passed the first test. One of many. Uh, yeah. Yeah, fuck him, right? No, they have a few less units now. Yeah, what does that mean? Yeah, welcome to my world. What the hell? WAH! OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO HIT YOU, BUT...! Hey! That's great! I don't think I shot you even once! You...are welcome. Yeah, I guessed that. Oh supplies, huh? I like supplies. Do you have any drugs? Like opioids, specifically. I'm not too picky right now, just not stimulants. I'm-- Oh, that's just for you, huh? Well...I don't blame you, but if you get me high, you pass all the tests. We can skip the rest of it. What's up here? This is where you keep the good stuff, right? Oh, more ammo. Wow! Okay. I think I've literally seen more ammo packs than soda cans by now. This is kind of cozy... for living in a sewer. A pot! I'd care more if you had food. Actually, I'm not that hungry now. My stomach's feeling...challenged. Okay, the big boxes. What do we have here? Supply time. Empty. What? They're empty! They're all empty! There's nothing here! Man, you're high! YOU SAID I COULD HAVE SUPPLIES, BUT ALL YOU HAVE IS AN EMPTY POT THAT YOU WEAR ON YOUR HEAD! Okay, you do have bullets; I'll give you that, although I don't know if I can carry any more. What is this? Ah, okay. The small package. This has got to be it, right? Yeah, this looks legit. Are you kidding me? It's empty. "Yes, please help yourself to my wide supply of empty boxes "and a glowing breathalyzer. "And bullets. I naturally have lots of those "because I have no gun to shoot them with." I think his mind's baked. He's just gathering random things and calling them supplies. And lives in a sewer. Listen, Johnny Appleseed, you're low on supplies. Oh, you're having a bad trip. I can see that. Okay, I'll go easy on you. Oh yeah. So this is a manhack, huh? It's just a flying circular saw, isn't it? This isn't what I thought at all! This is redneck technology! It's obvious. I can tell you right now this was invented by some guy duct-taping a circular saw to a remote controlled helicopter to keep people off his property. Wait, what? You're not coming? You just said I'm the last man through, you're shutting this down. The cops are not far behind me. You think they won't shoot you if-- Okay, forget it. I don't have time for this. Well, that was nice of him to give me the bullets, but considering how plentiful those are, plus he held out on the drugs, I think that makes us even. That's not a happy sound. AH HAH! They're not even that fast. You are no match against me and your nemesis: the chainlink fence. Whoa! Spring hinge. They're probably using a simple AI: just fly at anything human-shaped that shows up in infrared. That's how--Oop! I'm not even sure if they can process corners but why learn the hard way? Chain-link shields up! WOW! Did they blow themselves up? How did they set that on fire? I'm not impressed by these things. I think they just fly in a straight line. Yep! All gone! All that technology going into something stupid. I mean, sure, they're dangerous but not very effective. Okay, check the corners...! If your top-end robotic assault device can be defeated with a baseball bat every time, well that kind of says it all, doesn't it? Okay, I'll take a few more bullets since you insist. But yeah, the engineering behind that isn't lost on me, it's just--Okay, wait. I don't see anyone. Seems calm. I'm opening the door. I'm walking through the door--God dammit. Keep going--Nope! I'd rather be theorizing! The expectations are so different. Oop! Now I'm a street physicist. Thwarted again! Okay, wait. Let's see this. Let's see this. Yep! Straight line right at the fence! Yeah, keep coming, I'm here! I've got the bullets! Let's do this! Oh, more! Yeah! Let's get this out of the way! Any more? I'm happy to shoot more robots that can't hurt me. That's not a problem. Okay, I'm opening the door. I'm walking through the door. I SAID, "I'M WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR!" I guess they ran out of manhacks. Good. Yeah, being a street physicist is kind of a downgrade from where I was. It's mostly just kinetic energy and collisions. Yeah, see? Whoa! So where do I--? Hey, I think I'll shut the door? That should send them back to the drawing board. I'd feel better about this route if I could've stayed underground the whole time. Isn't that the point? To not be seen? I'm really acing that. Oh! Here we go! It would be nice to throw them off my trail for once. They probably don't expect me to climb into a ventilation shaft. I wouldn't. That's never really been a lifestyle choice... ...so much as a necessity. I swear, I haven't seen one fork in the path-- Oh shit! AH! FUCK THAT HURT! Why are you...? AH! MY FACE! MY BEAUTIFUL FACE! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?! FUCKIN' SAW BLADE-- PIECE OF SHIT, OVER-ENGINEERED ROBOT RAT TRAP...! THERE'S NO OPENING! IT REALLY WAS JUST SITTING HERE TO KILL RATS! Yeah, let's throw in AI, propulsion system, gyroscopes, infrared sensors, and some next-gen battery tech in there so we can kill rats. This had to be a Department of Defense contract. It's got all the signs. Oh, come ON! Anything in the boxes? Yes! No. All this ammo lying around. I still haven't figured that out. I figure this must be somebody's dream come true: Not being able to walk for five minutes without tripping over a canister of bullets. Not sure who or why though. Yeah, I'm full. A barred window. Is this a dungeon? Maybe. This is Europe...or Russia. Back the way I came in! So yeah, I guess manhacks are effective if you're spread prone in a vent and have trouble moving both your arms. For all I know, Black Mesa developed these, because--Shit! Did he see me? He might have. Well... What if-- Yes. He did. Haa, that's loud. That's okay. I think I'm going half deaf by now anyway. Boy, they're on my ASS, huh! That guy was, what, a minute behind me? Wait, the door's still shut. Did he do that? Or did he come up from the bottom? THEY'RE IN THE WALLS! Wait, no, that's aliens. Okay, I don't see anyone. Hmm. Could he fit through there? No, I don't think so. So this is my best lead. Well, I'll just take things nice and easy. Ba-HO-HO-HO...! YOU SCARED ME! "No, Gordon, people aren't flying down from the sky "to come kill you like some sort of fallen angel! You're just being paranoid!" Yeah, who am I to argue with dead people? Oh! A machine gun! This is just what the doctor ordered for my itchy trigger finger. Now it doesn't need to twitch so much. Hup! Yeah, more! Join the club! This is an open invite. What the fuck was that? Well... I've got a machine gun! I get the feeling that's going to be my answer to a lot of questions. Uh... So this is a dead end? But this is the only way. Am I missing something? Is there a trampoline I'm supposed to bounce out of here on? Why would there be all this infrastructure just to lead to nothing?! It's all barred off! What the fuck?! HELLO! Well... I have a machine gun! Hmmm... BLAH! Hmm. I guess I shouldn't do that. I might need it. I mean, I might not. Things could just calm down from here and--dammit, I can't do this optimism shit! I didn't become a scientist by ignoring observed evidence. There's gotta be something-- Oh, is this a gate that opens? No! This is as solid as all hell! What's even the point of this? There's no-- There's not. That's a tunnel! This could be what I-- There's no current; what does this turbine even... Oh no. Not again! Do I spin with it or get-- Shit. Okay, uh... Clockwise... Or is it... No! WUAH! Air! That's great! Wasn't so sure I was going to have that. Well... As far as hiding places go... ...this is pretty good. But...it has other problems. Huh. That was better than a lot of them. I didn't even die. This is not promising. This is a lot more promising. Could I have an actual hideout this time? I mean they're not going to follow me through the water... Oh NO! AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAH! AAAH! Get the fuck--AAAAAAAH! MY EYES! STOP IT STOP STOP! DEAD! NYAH! NYAAAH! AM I GOING TO SEE AGAIN?! Yeah... I can still see... ...TODAY! I'm going to end up like Ted! He wore sunglasses all the time; didn't matter what was happening. Be prepared? He was also a chain-smoker, but he did good work. Ted wasn't-- Shit. YEAH! I'M NOT IMAGINING IT! THEY CAME IN FROM THE SKY! THEY'RE FROM THE SKY! WELCOME TO THE GROUND! "If you'd like to make a call, please die before dialing--" Whoa! Just because you can't move doesn't mean you should sneak up on people like that! IF I WANT HELP SLOWLY RIPPING MY OWN HEAD OFF, I'LL ASK FOR IT! Hey, isn't this-- AH! AAAH! I can't... I'm running a little low here! Oh for crying out loud! Okay, switch the rounds. Oh, what the hell? This is a different caliber for this gun! What...? Well, I'm almost spent; I don't have time for-- Okay, FINE! Okay, now I can think for ONE SECOND! Dammit! At Black Mesa, all the pistols and machine guns used the same ammo! What's wrong with these cops? They just have so much ammo, they don't care. Well, I care! And I've gone in circles again! What about the sky? Anyone still there? No wonder they're on my ass if I'm going in circles! I missed the first day of fugitive class! But the thing is I've been following the ONLY PATH in front of me! Nope! It's the damned canals! NGYAH! And Barney...! So I guess the first lesson of being a fugitive is DON'T TAKE ADVICE FROM A FUCKING COP ON HOW TO GET AWAY FROM THE COPS! BLAH! Ooh, that's hot... Jeez. It doesn't seem to bother the tongue thing. I'm still surprised they're not from a swamp planet. I'm not even sure how to describe where they're from. Flammable. Yep! He went for it! This is kind of tight... Ehh... Good enough. I'm covering my ears. OH! That's a rush! That'd be good at concerts: set off explosives behind the stage at the peak of the song to really bring the bass home. Bum-bum-bum-bum-poooorrrrfffshhh ! Ah. This is not the fun corner. Yep. I'll leave the skull. I'm not greedy. Why is this venting so much? Is this preventing the city from blowing up? Hoo-ba-BA! AH! Ah... Now every time my face hurts, I'm going to think of Kleiner. And no helmet. Yeah, straight lines. STRAIGHT LINES! Good. Why is this barred off? This metal looks too new to be a dungeon. Ha! Lambda, huh? Maybe I'm not the only street physicist. Okay, boarded off. That's what I want to see. That means I'm the only person...that comes down here. Really, I'd like it if I could nail them back up, but-- Oh! Somebody stashed some ammo here. And themself, just to be safe. Fuck, uh... Okay, come on! Are you kidding me? Boy, I can see why they caged this off; wouldn't want somebody to get bored. This IS a pretty sweet hiding spot though I'm not sure that matters. It's those damned floating paparazzi bots. As soon as they found me, the police were on me in seconds. Maybe that's why the cops are so dumb: They just get orders where to go and shoot anything that moves. Oh here we go. This looks promising. You could hide some bodies in here. Maybe that's why this is caged off. Guess it's their lunch break. Well... Be prepared. These new rounds fit. That's great. Enjoy your tacos. I'll have dessert here if you want some though I'm not sure I have enough for everybody. I sure hope so. I've been here! What was the point of any of this?! Secure the water... Oh, shit! It's the taco truck! This again... It's on fire! AAAH! AAAH! OKAY, I GUESS I'D LIKE SOME CHICKEN WITH LETTUCE! ...TOMATOES! ...ONIONS! UH, HARD SHELL, MEDIUM SALSA! DAMMIT, I SAID MEDIUM SALSA! THIS IS TOO HOT! IT'S STILL TOO HOT! I'M CHANGING MY ORDER! DID YOU GET ALL THAT?! Okay, good. Dammit. More's going on than I'm what seeing here. They were completely ready for me with their barrels of fun, but then they jumped into the trench with me. Yeah... Why would they give up their tactical advantage that they set up? That doesn't... The cops gunning for me are NOT the same ones tracking me. The intelligence divide is too big. Once again, your kind adds nothing to the discussion. And don't even get me started on you. That's really the problem, though. These fucking bots! Maybe not the saw-blade ones but for sure the flash-bangers. They've gotta stop tracking me. Ah! Okay... Yeah... I don't think these have trackers on them. They... They're too dumb. The data would be too noisy. They would track every moving object in the city. Ah, I think that's it. The flash-bangers transmit my location, that's read by a computer, which predicts my route, which sends orders to the cops, who have trouble not shooting themselves, and that's it. There's no human oversight at all! It's all on auto-pilot! Wait, what the hell? Is this a dead end? Then why have all the fencing and the bars just to protect a bunch of rubble...? I've got to be missing something. There were five saw-bots trying to kill me and-- No, NO! I'm sick of this! I'm going to bust open that pipe and we're going to find some answers together, because I'm not going back to the-- Oh wait. Shit. Air vent. Okay. If this loops back, I'm going to murder someone, but I guess I've already done that. Well, I feel like I'm learning more. It's all automated. It feels like the entire world is conspiring against me because it actually is! Though technically-- I forgot what I was thinking about. Something... Shit. That's too many! That's too many! Okay...no! That's... Wah! Dammit. Okay, no, no... You're getting me dizzy! Stop...! Fuck... BLAAH! GET 'EM OFF! JESUS CHRIST, THAT'S CLOSE! What the fuck? Oh my god! Okay, I guess those ARE dangerous when there's...a million of them. But that's true of anything. A Nerf bat'll kill you if it's shoved down your esophagus! Manhacks... They don't care which man they hack up? I guess not! That's what I was saying earlier! Jeez, that's a lot of fuel barrels. Good thing we had a firefight in here! Grr... But yeah. That's the logic trap I was slipping into a little bit. There IS a conspiracy of the whole world against me, but is it JUST me? Because most people think--yeah, great place for the pipe here. Oh what? This is caged off?! This is so pointless! Okay, I don't feel like going into monkey mode just yet. I'm sore. But yeah, most people who think the world is out to get them aren't that important; it's just out to get everybody and they're...there. But I AM that important, so how do I know? People think it's great being me and...it is, but I have problems they don't. Well, the ones that aren't dead. Okay, how is anyone even supposed to get in here? There's nothing up here. Why even...? Okay, it must come in through the bottom here. I'd call this bad design but I don't know what this room is. Okay, what the fuck? How am I supposed to...? I can't reach this. The walls are wet... All right! Monkey mode it is! Ook-ACK! Well I'll say this: In all my time in the drain here, I haven't seen one rat. Maybe the manhacks aren't meant to kill people specifically, but are just there to kill anything, so we let them loose in the city to see what happens. I haven't seen any dogs or cats either. This is a pain in the ass with this armor. So yeah. It looks like Ninja Turtles had it right. Wouldn't have guessed that. We have MOUSERS. They're just flying and don't look as cool. I'd actually be kind of honored if... No, not by you. Okay... Why is this barred off? It looks like solid steel. Oh, what? Is the entrance at the bottom? Yeah, probably. Well, I think MOUSERS were the only thing Ninja Turtles was right about. And Dimension X, sort of. And of course ninjas. But no mutants, no robotic foot soldiers. That's what makes this reality. Okay, that looks welded shut, so what the hell is going on here?! Come on... What is this place?! It's a fucking Mario pipe maze in a flooded chamber right next to a fuel depot, and it's ALL CAGED OFF, because... I bet the police right now know exactly where I am but they can't figure how to get here either. Okay, THAT looks like an exit. THAT looks normal, so let's start from there. These bars are blocking the view. I'm going to get a better look from over here. Yeah, this is better. Okay, yeah, there's that tunnel. So that's how I get over there. Never mind the fact that I can't get into the tunnel because it's too high up. Am I missing something? Was there another ladder? No! It's all covered in a steel mesh! How am I supposed to...? Okay, wait wait. Wait. There's a ladder there... So if I get through the tunnel... Jeez, almost fell off... I come up the ladder...but that's on THIS side. How do I get on THAT side? Maybe I could lunge towards the edge but... I can't make that jump directly! N...dah! Maybe this was a mistake...
